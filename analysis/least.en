so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bot@@ tom@@ -up construction approach@@ es for architecture , which contr@@ ast the current , vic@@ tor@@ ian , top@@ -@@ down metho@@ ds which im@@ pose structure upon matter .
last week , bill clin@@ ton at the ted a@@ wards said , &quot; this situation is un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented , un@@ equal , un@@ fair and un@@ stable . &quot;
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shu@@ t it , at this point .
so i had a very inven@@ tive teacher , a paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m , who wanted to teach us about this .
you can show a mo@@ squ@@ e , or you can show wor@@ shi@@ p@@ pers , but there &apos;s not a stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward way of de@@ pic@@ ting islam .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network dom@@ es .
un@@ cle gets dr@@ un@@ k , doesn &apos;t use con@@ dom . come back , start again . &quot;
199@@ 5 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 -- we &apos;re finding about two or three a month .
or maybe that big ?
but i brought along here a l@@ um@@ p of coal -- right here , one l@@ um@@ p of coal .
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak flu@@ ent japanese and i know ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bi@@ c system , so i &apos;m going to show you the lim@@ bi@@ c system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
so , all this work is getting shown in art g@@ aller@@ ies .
their vot@@ ers are local .
my pen@@ sion was in it .
and in this , to@@ w@@ ns begin to re@@ think how they organi@@ ze the urban landscape , so that people are encoura@@ ged to slow down and smell the ro@@ ses and connect with one another .
it is extremely un@@ likely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely un@@ likely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s wid@@ ely re@@ gar@@ ded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requ@@ ir@@ ing an organ has dou@@ bled , while in the same time , the actual number of transplan@@ ts has bar@@ ely gone up .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vision or blin@@ dness .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from ta@@ hri@@ r square .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interven@@ tions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down pay@@ ment on her house .
as a si@@ del@@ ine , you know that the only red fla@@ g that po@@ pped up here was a sub@@ marine from an un@@ named country that plan@@ ted a red fla@@ g at the bottom of the arc@@ tic to be able to control the oil resources .
like my wish that no one went hun@@ gry or that everything were a free kind of u@@ top@@ ia .
you knew !
so they want an exc@@ use -- public opini@@ on is a very good exc@@ use to pun@@ ish him .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa to find these rob@@ ust self-@@ organi@@ zing algorith@@ ms .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &apos;d been at this hu@@ t .
what time of life had they started school ?
so pretty much players are encoura@@ ged to be very creative in the game .
we look at the sav@@ ings rate and it has been dec@@ lin@@ ing since the 195@@ 0s .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gen@@ ce of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental de@@ gra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
the lesson of brian &apos;s pres@@ entation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that van@@ tage point determin@@ es everything that you see .
i think there is a soci@@ ali@@ zing dimension in , kind of , moving that bor@@ der .
the view is den@@ i@@ ed in the g@@ aller@@ ies where we recei@@ ve just natural light , and then ex@@ posed again in the north g@@ aller@@ y with a pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic view .
so if you go back into the par@@ king , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like travel@@ ing into a par@@ alle@@ l universe from cars and colors , into this sort of sou@@ th-@@ facing urban o@@ as@@ is .
would they give me char@@ ts and graph@@ s that i could color ?
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version : can we build a mechan@@ ical system in in@@ organic materials that will do the same thing ?
one of the -- thank you for invi@@ ting us .
but the worst part was , not the spon@@ tane@@ ous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
i have a bunch of other inven@@ tions .
so we &apos;re living in the age of sur@@ ging income ine@@ quality , especially at the top .
however , under some circum@@ stances , it can happen .
and interest@@ ingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ ment@@ alists .
but life expec@@ tan@@ cy in this country is only 7@@ 8 .
i made a radical hypo@@ thesis .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero toler@@ ance poli@@ cies .
i come out of the adverti@@ sing and design business .
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful spar@@ kl@@ ing thing , with the dis@@ k slowly ro@@ tat@@ ing , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imag@@ in@@ ative way , so that they can start c@@ ali@@ br@@ ating their instin@@ ct across these vast sc@@ ales of space and time .
they &apos;re learning to fle@@ x this system that rele@@ ases their own en@@ do@@ gen@@ ous op@@ i@@ ates .
fro@@ og@@ le lets you search sh@@ opp@@ ing information , and blog@@ ger lets you publi@@ sh things .
here are some recent images .
so it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in the upp@@ er part of this f@@ at@@ ty breast .
he &apos;s all mur@@ ky . there is little kids le@@ an@@ ing on his leg , little g@@ ho@@ sts flying around . we got@@ ta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentle@@ men .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eg@@ gs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
india , mexico and others are already making experiment@@ al flu vac@@ cin@@ es , and they may be the first place we see these vac@@ cin@@ es in use .
but in that year , small@@ po@@ x explo@@ ded throughout india .
that &apos;s a multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tas@@ ker .
we need an anti-@@ temp@@ le@@ ton to step forward .
you can have re@@ gener@@ ative bra@@ king ; you can have dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ y-@@ wire ; you can have re@@ plac@@ e@@ able body shapes -- it &apos;s a little thing that starts with a hy@@ bri@@ d , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
i had been growing all my own food .
it had become a part of my body , an exten@@ sion of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my offi@@ cial image .
when i look around this tedx@@ am@@ ster@@ dam venue , i see a very special audience .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by -- in the same way that it thre@@ at@@ ens -- the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ent industrial systems .
&quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can as@@ sure you that this qu@@ ir@@ k you &apos;re so self-@@ conscious of is inten@@ sely en@@ de@@ aring .
and when it &apos;s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a si@@ x-@@ course du@@ ck dinner .
there is no change in blood flow , in di@@ lat@@ ation of the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
and so i went home , and i made a prototyp@@ e of this hat .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dic@@ tion@@ ary , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pur@@ suit as to &quot; ch@@ ase with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty . &quot;
and mean@@ while , i was tour@@ ing lo@@ cally and playing in ni@@ ght@@ clu@@ bs with my band , the d@@ res@@ den doll@@ s .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common can@@ cers like breast , pro@@ state and col@@ on cancer .
but a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
and those bu@@ mp@@ s act like a mag@@ net for water .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speak@@ ers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glas@@ ses and be slightly more d@@ res@@ se@@ d-@@ up than the average ted speak@@ er .
you just drive to the ne@@ ar@@ est la@@ ke , stick your ho@@ se in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy applied to people .
thanks very much for your attention .
thank you very much for listening .
for example , dan p@@ ink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &apos;t seen it : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men , mostly midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men .
and par@@ alle@@ l to my cutting is my running .
and because of that announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- whereas i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and raising a round of vent@@ ure capital and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
and i can tell you two great stories .
when food is sc@@ ar@@ ce , they diver@@ t nutri@@ ents towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and li@@ ver .
sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times che@@ aper than the current op@@ tions .
and when i made my way to that pi@@ ping ch@@ im@@ ney i &apos;d seen in the distance , i saw han@@ na za@@ vor@@ ot@@ n@@ ya , and i met her .
i received a box in the mail and it was wra@@ pped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investi@@ g@@ ating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion — oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty sho@@ cking , but more about that later .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sac@@ red because he believed that the function of religion was to uni@@ te people into a group , into a moral community .
us@@ eless .
but you &apos;ve got to ask yourself in the mean@@ time : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who &apos;s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who &apos;s going to dra@@ g a 40@@ 0-@@ po@@ und electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m through the door ?
right now , as bill mc@@ don@@ ough has poin@@ ted out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
i intervie@@ wed these people because they all taught in bu@@ en@@ os air@@ es .
but if we could move char@@ it@@ able giving from two percent of g@@ dp up just one step to three percent of g@@ dp , by invest@@ ing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contribu@@ tions , and if that money could go dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately to health and human services ch@@ ari@@ ties , because those were the ones we encoura@@ ged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tri@@ pl@@ ing of contribu@@ tions to that sector .
i set up the type , i prin@@ ted it out on an ep@@ son prin@@ ter with wat@@ er-@@ solu@@ ble ink , ta@@ ped it to the wall and thre@@ w a bu@@ cket of water at it . pre@@ st@@ o !
and the night before my fir@@ st-@@ year talk , and the fir@@ st-@@ year talk at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on is a 20@@ -@@ minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to inter@@ acting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respe@@ ctive fields .
what jack ni@@ chol@@ son might be up to in his cele@@ bri@@ ty life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road ra@@ ge and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ b@@ bed a driver the other day .
how should we really honor fe@@ yn@@ man ?
you find eleph@@ ants , r@@ hin@@ os , mon@@ keys , pig@@ s , etc .
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched publi@@ c@@ ly yet .
so i now have this sort of restaurant men@@ u vis@@ iting of art g@@ aller@@ ies .
we now know that at g@@ om@@ be alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanze@@ es use different objects for different pur@@ pos@@ es .
i know a 14@@ -year-old girl in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , for example , who is dem@@ and@@ ing that she take a boat and go around the entire world by her@@ self .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scrat@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
we &apos;re often all fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of sharks thanks to &quot; ja@@ ws . &quot;
now , the activi@@ ties from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
there are other par@@ as@@ ites that do this -- which ren@@ der the ho@@ st ster@@ i@@ le .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully hon@@ est@@ y for the sa@@ ke of hon@@ est@@ y , but a hope that by being more honest and can@@ did about these experiences , that we can all colle@@ c@@ tively b@@ end that happiness bas@@ eline up a little bit .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the in@@ her@@ ent sugar tra@@ pped in the star@@ ch .
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passi@@ ve consum@@ ers to cre@@ ators , to highly en@@ ab@@ led collabor@@ ators .
you get a job and get out of the house .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t , like a little brother into a little sister &apos;s room .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dy@@ ed , you know , that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar color of blue that mat@@ ches her pol@@ ye@@ ster pants suit , you know , same color as the bu@@ i@@ ck .
mar@@ c@@ us : and how many soldiers have you rec@@ ru@@ ited to fight this war with you ?
now why am i talking about co@@ ws ?
jon@@ as eli@@ as@@ son : how to solve traffic j@@ ams
and he wrote to the acade@@ mi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
because it &apos;s obviously incredibly fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infe@@ ction from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
fortunately , ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty rema@@ ins the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &apos;re the most proud of with the air@@ craft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continu@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ vari@@ able trans@@ mission and li@@ qui@@ d-@@ based cool@@ ing system that allows us to use an air@@ craft engine in stop@@ -@@ and-@@ go traffic , to a custom@@ -@@ designed ge@@ ar@@ box that power@@ s either the prop@@ eller when you &apos;re flying or the whe@@ els on the ground , to the auto@@ ma@@ ted w@@ ing-@@ fol@@ ding mechan@@ ism that we &apos;ll see in a moment , to crash safety fe@@ atures .
when you read this pra@@ yer , it sounds incredibly sel@@ fish , self-@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &quot; remark@@ ably un@@ remarkable . &quot;
i would argue , in britain there &apos;s a much better frame of re@@ ference , which is to tell people that more fir@@ st-@@ class mail arri@@ ves the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
if you don &apos;t have open spaces , you &apos;ve got to go there and open spaces .
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
non@@ eth@@ eless , if we want to attra@@ ct deep down athei@@ sts to come out publi@@ c@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our ban@@ ner than &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y &quot; or &quot; tea@@ po@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
he came up with our name and lo@@ go . we &apos;re mission mot@@ ors .
this del@@ u@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restri@@ cting us to our personal des@@ ires and to affe@@ ction for a few person@@ s ne@@ ar@@ est to us .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .

standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embra@@ cing violence .
there &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a d@@ res@@ s@@ maker &apos;s shop se@@ wing clo@@ th@@ es .

and he poin@@ ted up to the sky , and he said , &quot; look , do you see that ?
there are no quick fi@@ xes .
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences refle@@ ct on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
so sur@@ ely if a patent pool could be establi@@ shed to ra@@ mp up the production of military air@@ planes , we should be able to do something similar to t@@ ack@@ le the hiv / aids epidemic .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .

the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
here &apos;s the first battery -- a st@@ ack of co@@ ins , zin@@ c and sil@@ ver , separ@@ ated by car@@ d@@ board so@@ ak@@ ed in br@@ ine .

well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-@@ law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navi@@ gate by needs you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to imple@@ ment change is very limited .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic stat@@ ements .
i would per@@ c@@ uss the ch@@ est . i would listen to the heart .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
electr@@ on@@ ics k@@ its are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts in@@ her@@ ent in their design influence the way we learn .
because there &apos;s no market for post office tru@@ cks .

today these low pri@@ ces are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 6@@ 2 countries , and about 5@@ 5@@ 0,000 people are getting the benefits of them .

once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a c@@ age with a hole , and actually the animal lear@@ ns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target sc@@ ent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
it &apos;s our invisible reality .
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ en@@ cies , but i can &apos;t imagine that every a@@ partment having its own air condi@@ tion@@ er is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .

so each of you has really just a couple sent@@ ences -- 30 seconds each to sum up .
peter at@@ ti@@ a : is the o@@ bes@@ ity crisis hi@@ ding a bigger problem ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the re@@ ception des@@ k .
and i would say the non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more inten@@ se over time because of technologi@@ cal trends , but more inten@@ se in a kind of negative way .
we started with a motor with a little le@@ ver , a little force trans@@ f@@ user .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our c@@ ad / cam@@ s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about ther@@ mal properties , know about design , know about atmosp@@ her@@ ic interaction , par@@ ach@@ utes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spac@@ ec@@ raft in a computer to some ex@@ tent , so to see , does that meet the requi@@ re@@ ment that we need .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a ra@@ il@@ way em@@ bank@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your hori@@ zon .
and the reason the effici@@ en@@ cies are so low is these re@@ ac@@ tors operate at pretty low temperature .
this worked well for most pa@@ tho@@ gens , some@@ what well for cra@@ f@@ ty bu@@ gs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural imm@@ unity .
for those without dis@@ abilities , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated according to age and gender , they are arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily separ@@ ated from their si@@ bl@@ ings , often without even a chance to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
now what &apos;s interesting about that is ir@@ regular ver@@ bs between al@@ fre@@ d and ja@@ y-@@ z have become more regular .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundament@@ ally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
it en@@ ables testing of new ideas in a way that &apos;s less difficult for everybody .
how did we become the only species that becomes more pro@@ sper@@ ous as it becomes more popul@@ ous ?
it turns out to have a fore@@ brain one-@@ fif@@ te@@ ent@@ h the size of a human .
and then to generate the display you &apos;re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its ner@@ ve ring with a shar@@ p pick that &apos;s sort of like the shar@@ p to@@ oth of a fish .
it looked more like this when it was all wra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
but it was a little bit bor@@ ing .
i felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so i was determin@@ ed to do anything possible to recei@@ ve education .
computers will com@@ bine the sub@@ tle pan@@ -@@ recogni@@ tion power@@ s of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already super@@ ior , in terms of doing analy@@ tic thinking , remem@@ ber@@ ing billions of facts ac@@ cur@@ ately .
it lear@@ ns very much from its mistakes .
i am a neuro@@ scientist with a mix@@ ed background in physics and medicine .
that exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates and continu@@ es this model .
and what &apos;s the context of the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ lands ?
and the black rock is the se@@ di@@ ment on the sea bottom in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of plan@@ k@@ ton .
and i think because early on , frank@@ ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator of the gy@@ m@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist &apos;s life was infin@@ ity .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
and let me just sum@@ mar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
we should mer@@ ely report on what repu@@ table par@@ ties have said about it .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &apos;t disc@@ uss universal access to hiv &#91; medicine &#93; for that qu@@ inti@@ le up here with the same strategy as down here . the impro@@ vement of the world must be highly con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alized , and it &apos;s not relevant to have it on regi@@ onal level . we must be much more deta@@ iled .
and i want to first re@@ he@@ ar@@ se with you your whi@@ st@@ ling .
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , a@@ stra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a , general electric , phili@@ ps , have already ans@@ wer@@ ed in the aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive the question that from their bang@@ al@@ ore and hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad r &amp; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ dest growing seas@@ ons are going to be hot@@ ter than anything those cro@@ ps have seen in the past .
what the climate crisis has reve@@ aled to us is a secon@@ dar@@ y , more insi@@ di@@ ous and more per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve crisis , which is the crisis of agen@@ cy , which is what to do .
i went to per@@ forming arts high school , where i was an actor .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized sto@@ ma@@ chs and l@@ ung@@ s .
sort of like the spin@@ al ta@@ p scene where you get the tiny little st@@ one@@ hen@@ ge , i guess ?
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- im@@ men@@ se numbers .
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sa@@ ti@@ ation .
this something else is this dan@@ cing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
it &apos;s all about the foreign movies .
un@@ speak@@ ably dangerous .
i would say that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
it was a trying and sc@@ ary thing for a young kid to be going through .
and i will take kenya as an example .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super@@ -@@ human strength and abilities .
what we need is new ex@@ it strategi@@ es for argu@@ ments .
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head with the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ tail .
this is probably the sa@@ d@@ dest sound i &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organis@@ m , human or other .
they &apos;re the v@@ eins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty v@@ eins .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
this is 198@@ 8 -- we actually bom@@ bed two ir@@ ani@@ an oil plat@@ forms that year .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of b@@ end the rules of physics to suit our needs .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is sky@@ rock@@ eting , as you can tell from the price of oper@@ a ti@@ ckets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical ti@@ tles rele@@ ased , the number of new al@@ bu@@ ms and so on .
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &apos;t get a c@@ at . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
well , commercial hun@@ ting happened .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
i dra@@ ped them cas@@ ually over the chair in the doctor &apos;s office .
i came here to speak about ec@@ ology , and i em@@ it@@ ted as much co2 as a fren@@ ch@@ man in one year .
and there was something so beauti@@ fully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
from this pattern , we already know the partic@@ le physics of these tiny sc@@ ales . the way the universe works with these tiny sc@@ ales is very beautiful .
now , when i went to look at the fig@@ ures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , refle@@ cts the growth of the economy .
today , we can write a word such as ted in eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an hier@@ o@@ gl@@ yp@@ hi@@ cs and in c@@ un@@ ei@@ form scri@@ pt , because both of these were deci@@ pher@@ ed in the 19@@ th century .
one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to gover@@ n , to shape , this economy .
ef@@ h@@ ari@@ st@@ o and kal@@ in@@ ih@@ ta .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tor@@ na@@ do hit , playing with the tor@@ na@@ do display .
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &quot;
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they &apos;re a crimin@@ al ?
now , this might look kind of tri@@ vi@@ al , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any inter@@ active or any virtual worl@@ ds .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of s@@ alt , we heat them up to almost bo@@ il@@ ing and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short str@@ ands b@@ ind the long str@@ ands and start to form structure .
he takes basically everything .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those trans@@ form@@ ers using this technology , which is not dis@@ similar from the way an oper@@ a sing@@ er sh@@ at@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
you get something a little bit more complicated .
so you know how it ended up , spen@@ cer tra@@ cy brought a computer , a ma@@ infra@@ me computer of 195@@ 7 , in to help the libr@@ ari@@ ans .
the first is sel@@ ec@@ ting a feed@@ stock , pre@@ fer@@ ably something that &apos;s regi@@ onal , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
and that &apos;s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mo@@ od .
so if you look at security from economic terms , it &apos;s a tra@@ de-@@ off .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
of course , sea cu@@ cum@@ bers sho@@ ot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opini@@ on , makes them much more interesting a super@@ hero .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their ch@@ est go like this .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
men are rest@@ less , men are ambi@@ tious , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mobile , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
in 19@@ 35 , there were 15@@ 0,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd@@ t and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
we have to fix our im@@ migra@@ tion policy .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe na@@ tive americans were there .
here &apos;s one of my fellow w@@ inn@@ ers . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under far@@ ming conditions in britain . &quot;
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating principle of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
who are these characters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
and the ship sin@@ ks , and the cap@@ tain has lost everything , but for a life jac@@ ket .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of this earli@@ est of play scen@@ es and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in war@@ e@@ houses .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe how bat@@ s sing , or how wh@@ ales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of ton@@ al sc@@ ales .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after w@@ inning the lot@@ to , lot@@ tery w@@ inn@@ ers and par@@ ap@@ legi@@ cs are equ@@ ally happy with their lives .
he &apos;s got to find himself a bab@@ e and then he &apos;s got to lat@@ ch on for life .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
i was in a wheel@@ chair ; i didn &apos;t look like a lo@@ ot@@ er .
and despite all of our best eff@@ or@@ ts and inten@@ tions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
i actually love di@@ ving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the da@@ y@@ time .
it is bar@@ ely te@@ ther@@ ed to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century : a little bit over two percent .
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth car@@ ing about and a nation that will be worth defen@@ ding .
and then -- three par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s later we get this little beauty : &quot; we went back to bla@@ ir house to look at the speech for the last time .
this is like the ste@@ al@@ th bom@@ ber of the ocean .
she works for a very big company , a work@@ shop in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , making fur@@ ni@@ tures .
i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it when mi@@ ster pu@@ tin turns off the gas ta@@ p , because my budget goes up .
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we &apos;ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tenden@@ cy to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
i app@@ ren@@ tic@@ ed with a car@@ p@@ enter and learned about pl@@ um@@ b , square and level .
the traditional thing would be to bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t right ?
so , there &apos;s 40 of these tu@@ bes , like a v-@@ 40 engine running the memory .
the more surprising thing was that when we collabor@@ ated with econom@@ ists to actually look at the mon@@ keys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically mat@@ ched , not just qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively , but quanti@@ ta@@ tively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio v@@ acc@@ ine that tar@@ ge@@ ted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diam@@ ond , or , you know , diag@@ onal .
the united states had developed a couple of atom@@ ic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : we would use the power of the at@@ om to end the at@@ ro@@ cities and the hor@@ ror of this un@@ en@@ ding world war ii that we &apos;d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
we became much more social . the social networks exp@@ and@@ ed .
in a region famous for the soft , por@@ ous lo@@ ess plat@@ e@@ au soil , there lived until recently an esti@@ ma@@ ted 40 million people in these houses under@@ ground .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
and he grab@@ s my arm and the transl@@ ator &apos;s , and du@@ cks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
90 percent of the fund@@ ing came from th@@ a@@ il@@ and .
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ ternal , om@@ ni@@ present , all@@ -@@ powerful .
it dis@@ integr@@ ates a few months later .
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ tern@@ ally wra@@ p the pi@@ pe .
the system is also smart enough to figure out the sa@@ fest way to operate the car .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
all three of the fo@@ under@@ s of net@@ scap@@ e had it .
and these doctors or these ma@@ sters , these spi@@ ritual ma@@ sters of the su@@ f@@ i tradition , re@@ fer to teach@@ ings and examples of our prop@@ he@@ t that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
and you can see that it kind of ho@@ ck@@ ey sti@@ cks up around the 196@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , and it &apos;s on kind of a nice tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory right now .
now is there any alternative to this ?
it &apos;s had no serious ri@@ v@@ als .
okay , so it causes a small invol@@ un@@ t@@ ary contra@@ ction in my hand by putting a magnetic pul@@ se in my brain .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
that gives you an idea of the different types of mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions and de@@ dic@@ ation .
this one gener@@ ates no ima@@ gery at all . &quot;
the british government -- any government is poten@@ tially the worst cli@@ ent in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
and one of the ast@@ on@@ ishing predic@@ tions of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that descri@@ bes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reach@@ ed the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.@@ 4 times the mass of the sun .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagno@@ sed with autis@@ m are actually suffering from hidden brain sei@@ zur@@ es .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depen@@ ds on the planet ?
i &apos;ll go you one stran@@ ger than that : in 197@@ 4 , during the production of a weird com@@ e@@ dy sequ@@ el to &quot; the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on , &quot; called &quot; the black bird , &quot; star@@ ring george se@@ g@@ al , the los angeles coun@@ ty museum of art had a pla@@ ster original of the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on -- one of the original six pla@@ sters , i think , made for the movie -- stol@@ en out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publi@@ city st@@ unt for the movie .
but i will demon@@ strate different ways to get rid of diffic@@ ul@@ ties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quick@@ er than ar@@ th@@ ur did . so , first , we viol@@ ate the common sense , the lo@@ gic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you .
so , once you have mo@@ bility , now you &apos;re making a lot of eng@@ ines because you &apos;ve got lots of un@@ its , as op@@ posed to ste@@ am ships or big fac@@ tor@@ ies where you &apos;re not making as many un@@ its , so this was the engine that ended up benef@@ iting from mass production where all the other eng@@ ines didn &apos;t benefit .
this here is nis@@ san &apos;s my@@ lea@@ f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compe@@ te for who dri@@ ves around the most fuel effici@@ ently .
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
if this idea is truly sound , then the impli@@ cations are significant .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the impli@@ cation over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i ci@@ te our own experience as a company , and i just illu@@ strate that by a small sele@@ ction of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
this was a bad idea , because phili@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don had a son called alex@@ ander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the co@@ w cros@@ sed the road , or the road moved underneath the co@@ w , depen@@ ds on your frame of re@@ ference . &quot;
and somewhere in the middle of south da@@ k@@ ota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole explo@@ it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quar@@ ters .
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
at the comm@@ enting area , &#91; it makes &#93; the chinese weib@@ o more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the after@@ math of the cu@@ ban revolution .
and so@@ on@@ er or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
that means they &apos;re totally out of syn@@ c in traditional clas@@ ses , which are anal@@ o@@ g , sta@@ tic , inter@@ ac@@ tively passi@@ ve .
i don &apos;t understand why the media is focused on eastern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and land@@ ed .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; bas@@ ics ? &quot;
li@@ ke@@ wise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re disco@@ vering that the 80 solar farm sch@@ em@@ es that are going forward want to basically bu@@ ll@@ do@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
so j@@ ul@@ ie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her as@@ th@@ ma .
we are not talking about 5@@ 0,000 dollars here , or 100,000 dollars there , or one million dollars there .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
so , the new festi@@ val , it as@@ ks the audience to play an essential role in sha@@ ping the performance .
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be ar@@ re@@ sted , so he supp@@ lied everybody with this fa@@ ke volunte@@ er card .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
and at heart , both re@@ forma@@ tions , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
but maybe bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing isn &apos;t always bad .
if you sub@@ stit@@ ute the word blo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
we can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and i cla@@ im that the engineering approach is within range .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict en@@ han@@ ced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an en@@ han@@ ced level .
now , how can you have a deep tan and have no wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es ?
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
again , this is no m@@ ere hypo@@ the@@ tical .
and in all that area , they &apos;re only r@@ ar@@ ely found bre@@ eding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
in other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neuron in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sensor@@ y cortex in the sensor@@ y region of the brain fir@@ es .
l@@ p : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
and , according to jes@@ us , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love yourself , you must love the l@@ ord your god with all your heart , mind and sou@@ l , and your neighb@@ or as yourself . &quot;
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e@@ . lee , john bu@@ ford at ge@@ tt@@ y@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
i began to be very dis@@ interested in computers themselves , so i began to make pain@@ t@@ ings out of pal@@ mp@@ il@@ ots .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding ste@@ ad@@ y .
the upp@@ er is n@@ yl@@ on 6 that can go back to ca@@ pro@@ l@@ ac@@ ta@@ m , the bottom , a pol@@ yo@@ le@@ ph@@ ine -- infin@@ itely recycl@@ able ther@@ m@@ op@@ la@@ stic .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harv@@ est@@ ed from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
and that ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al nature of the hydro@@ ther@@ mal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that i &apos;ve seen in 35 years of travel@@ ing around , making films .
the architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation was frank@@ ly just du@@ m@@ b .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
kb : what did you feel ?
this little boy will never step outside of the sac@@ red fields that surro@@ und the men &apos;s hu@@ t for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
a public place so dis@@ mal that the win@@ os don &apos;t even want to go there .
&#91; &quot; acade@@ my a@@ ward w@@ inner for visual effects &quot; &#93; second doctor : wel@@ come to your new body , ja@@ ke@@ .@@ first doctor : good .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
i cont@@ ac@@ ted a company in the states who make su@@ its for nasa .
it might well be that there are environmental fac@@ tors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic fac@@ tors we &apos;re not aware of .
what &apos;s also happening in shang@@ hai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
finally , in about the six@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , a physi@@ cian whose name was the@@ op@@ h@@ ra@@ st@@ us bom@@ ba@@ st@@ us au@@ re@@ ol@@ us von ho@@ hen@@ heim , called par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s found that he could predict the degree of con@@ vul@@ sion by using a measu@@ red amount of cam@@ ph@@ or to produce the con@@ vul@@ sion .
now you &apos;d think that &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; would introdu@@ ce a measure of americ@@ ani@@ zation .
and they do that by each year sending out the re@@ produ@@ c@@ tives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a ma@@ ting flight .
and the local finan@@ cing is not part of the ecosystem for suppor@@ ting hard@@ ware projects .
oni@@ ch@@ a : e@@ z@@ ra !
and finally , an e@@ bay li@@ sting for one well-@@ travel@@ ed slide show , now ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , museum piece . please contact al gore .
if i choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then i &apos;ll have a different comm@@ and , different noise , playing through a no@@ is@@ y system , very complicated .
so i &apos;ve color@@ ed in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in pur@@ ple . and you can see that the top repe@@ at unit can be expla@@ ined almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repe@@ at unit has a substan@@ tial amount of pur@@ ple .
we really need to change this whole paradig@@ m with kids and food .
and we are operating with a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive urban planning de@@ fic@@ it .
how was i supposed to live it ?
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the conne@@ ctive tissue of social graph@@ s and how they rel@@ ate to content .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ce@@ os , c@@ mo@@ s .
i actually just as@@ sm@@ ed the path@@ ologi@@ c sequence of events was sett@@ led science .
so here we were , a nuclear physi@@ c@@ ist , an intern@@ ist , soon jo@@ ined by car@@ r@@ ie hr@@ us@@ ka , a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the ent@@ ren@@ ched world of mammo@@ graph@@ y with a machine that was held together by du@@ ct ta@@ pe .
so it took me from places like chi@@ le -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chi@@ le -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and even to the south pole .
so , their entire year has been cut in half .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any brow@@ ser .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
this is t@@ ank pol@@ o in the south ham@@ p@@ tons .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
there &apos;s a counter@@ intui@@ tive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &apos;s look at the first me@@ tri@@ c here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity mi@@ mi@@ cked by men who grew up with no fa@@ thers , cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage wor@@ n by bu@@ lli@@ es who are danger@@ ously ar@@ med but need hu@@ gs .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , m@@ yo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skelet@@ al muscle cells ?
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in s@@ ant@@ a ana .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulner@@ abilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
so we have , in skin pig@@ ment@@ ation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
that day i ended up spending nearly 60 .
so we can bring an entirely new tele@@ pres@@ ence to the world , throughout the ocean .
and sequ@@ el truly is a real car .
&quot; be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
it &apos;s about creating with mini@@ mal means something which can not be repe@@ ated , cannot be simul@@ ated in any other sphere .
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surge@@ on , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , inten@@ se way .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two sta@@ ge@@ hands all in black with wat@@ ering cans ran along the top and started to po@@ ur water on the sand ca@@ st@@ le , and the sand ca@@ st@@ le started to dri@@ p and sin@@ k , but before it did , the audience saw the black@@ -@@ cla@@ d sta@@ ge@@ hands .
am i understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de that in your mind pro@@ ves that there have been past mass extin@@ ctions due to climate change ?
the problem is , without techni@@ cians , without sp@@ are parts , don@@ ations like this very quickly turn into jun@@ k .
the care@@ ful testing , re@@ testing , design , are going to open up vi@@ st@@ as of understanding , comple@@ xi@@ ties , difficult things .
k first time , a r@@ ally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why liter@@ acy is important .
so you start with the bag@@ asse , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fif@@ ty five-@@ gall@@ on oil dr@@ um .
now , i can ex@@ tend this cir@@ cular mag@@ net , and make whatever track i want .
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular refle@@ ction , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gro@@ ss cont@@ ours of the face and the basic shape , and aug@@ ment it with information that puts in all of that skin po@@ re structure and fine wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
these are some designs from eric dre@@ x@@ ler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are fe@@ asi@@ ble with super@@ -@@ computing simu@@ lations , where actually there are scientists building mole@@ cu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
i worked in other parts of new ze@@ al@@ and as well , in beautiful , fra@@ gi@@ le , prote@@ cted areas like in fi@@ ord@@ land , where this sea pen col@@ ony was found .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good lu@@ ck .
that i &apos;m this u@@ ber@@ -@@ en@@ dur@@ ance guy ?
and we eventually broke the code .
but organs don &apos;t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
markets have changed beyond recogni@@ tion in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
if i pass out on the next song ...
throughout human evolution , multiple ver@@ sions of humans co-@@ exi@@ sted . could we be mi@@ d-@@ up@@ grade now ? at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , ju@@ an en@@ ri@@ que@@ z s@@ wee@@ ps across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is reve@@ aling evidence that suggests ra@@ pid evolution may be under way .
es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o talked a little bit about this .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
i &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ pus .
and something fe@@ ster@@ ed inside me after this happened .
i would like to tell you a story conne@@ cting the not@@ ori@@ ous priv@@ acy inci@@ dent invol@@ ving adam and e@@ ve , and the remarkable shift in the boundar@@ ies between public and private which has occur@@ red in the past 10 years .
the den@@ sity of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consi@@ stent set of equ@@ ations that can describe the whole process .
in fact , they &apos;ve accoun@@ ted for half of all civil wars .
look at hom@@ i@@ cide at the bottom , for god &apos;s sa@@ ke .
it was ridi@@ cul@@ ous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn &apos;t travel with me .
we created the respon@@ sive room where the lights music and blin@@ ds ad@@ ju@@ sted to your state .
i close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- because we are all children at the table of mama e@@ ternal .
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reser@@ ves , is that the fund@@ ing models have been wrong .
now what you are sm@@ elling is a combin@@ ation of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
so we asked lar@@ ry and nat@@ al@@ ie he@@ m@@ pel to write a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to biology letters .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sti@@ cking to their g@@ uns , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what other people want or re@@ com@@ men@@ d .
and they have du@@ b@@ bed this water as the third one called &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
it &apos;s now two years that you &apos;ve been running ?
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very co@@ oper@@ ative animal .
you probably saw the hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale foot@@ age that we got there a month or two ago off coun@@ ty we@@ x@@ ford .
i &apos;ve always been with my band or my cre@@ w .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is in search of a mate , what would su@@ ki do to find the perfect mate ?
now why would this kind of fe@@ tal learning be useful ?
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , i learned about the par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a and how it could concent@@ rate ra@@ ys of light to a single focus .
and may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one instru@@ ction using a tu@@ tor .
but the question that l@@ ing@@ ered in my mind was , what causes people to destro@@ y fire tru@@ cks head@@ ed to their own homes ?
they meet ne@@ anderth@@ als , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in sou@@ the@@ ast asia , they meet den@@ iso@@ v@@ ans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexi@@ ble the kor@@ an is , at least in minds that are not fundament@@ ally in@@ flexi@@ ble .
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21@@ st of september as the date of peace .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely ten photos per photograph@@ er , is a lie .
so , for example , you can be a pit@@ cher or a cat@@ cher , and that cor@@ respon@@ ds to whether you per@@ form a sexual act or recei@@ ve a sexual act .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer common@@ place .
the assu@@ mption then that we do best when the individual self choo@@ ses only hol@@ ds when that self is clearly divi@@ ded from others .
so partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the streng@@ ths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determin@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions .
let me be very clear , and perhaps contro@@ versi@@ al , that open government is not about transpar@@ ent government .
both success@@ es and fail@@ ures teach us several cri@@ tically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
and the same pattern emer@@ ged in each conflict .
next best thing to a video game .
well , the argument in &quot; the blan@@ k s@@ late &quot; was that eli@@ te art and cri@@ tic@@ ism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis@@ da@@ ined beauty , pleasure , c@@ lar@@ ity , insi@@ ght and style .
sounds ridi@@ cul@@ ous , right .
these arti@@ facts and designs are in@@ spir@@ ing .
one of the people we intervie@@ wed was frank j@@ ord@@ an , former ma@@ yo@@ r of san francisco . before that he was ch@@ ie@@ f of police in san francisco .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ ils .
so , now we have , immediately , a re@@ al-@@ time map showing where there are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps -- rapi@@ dly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing re@@ lief work in port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ prin@@ ce .
can anybody see the bla@@ de on the end of that need@@ le ?
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poor@@ ly understood to say the least .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , cra@@ ig , le@@ o , z@@ em jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in and bas@@ il and me .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are ac@@ tors , those who are wri@@ ters , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ d@@ ently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recy@@ cle mas@@ ks .
and his clin@@ i@@ cian said to me , &quot; if you want to know more about psychop@@ a@@ ths , you can go on a psychop@@ ath spo@@ tting course run by robert h@@ are who invented the psychop@@ ath che@@ ck@@ list . &quot;
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of con@@ fron@@ tation with a sort of dis@@ son@@ ant -- i suppose it &apos;s an electro@@ magnetic force that somehow gover@@ ns your par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of ar@@ c of your whole life .
three different op@@ tions .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
the o@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans have this ance@@ st@@ or v@@ ener@@ ation .
if it &apos;s a tail -- well , rather dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted@@ ly , you put the glas@@ ses away and put the cham@@ pagne back .
so all the ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely deta@@ iled calcu@@ lations we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for lang@@ ley .
you can be pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ don@@ i@@ stic , nam@@ ely you focus on the jo@@ ys of life , or pres@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ alist -- it doesn &apos;t matter , your life is controlled .
so i have shown you this to demon@@ strate how many bo@@ ats , how many ves@@ sel@@ s it takes to catch one of these guys .
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
moment@@ um has been building .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are va@@ stly over@@ -@@ esti@@ ma@@ ted , nam@@ ely tor@@ na@@ does and fire@@ works .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s fortun@@ es are cor@@ related .
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning centers , and scan@@ ning their out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right books , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a p@@ ure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at gu@@ ess@@ ing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mu@@ tations -- and you use natural sele@@ ction to kill off not as good solutions .
and then when i did the second one , it really dist@@ ur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cr@@ as@@ hing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of ten@@ sion and an over@@ la@@ p .
and dre@@ w bar@@ r@@ y@@ more , for all her wonderful char@@ m , is not glam@@ or@@ ous either .
everyone was gl@@ u@@ ed to the tv , watching dist@@ ur@@ bing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
the main thing is a fi@@ x-@@ it@@ -@@ lo@@ cally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic system to get it fix@@ ed .
k@@ ak@@ i king : playing &quot; p@@ ink noise &quot; on gu@@ it@@ ar
ra@@ y@@ an re@@ fra@@ med the situation and brought himself down to my level .
because this is about 10 dollars of addi@@ tional hard@@ ware if you already have a n@@ inten@@ do wi@@ i .
i first saw this in a can@@ adi@@ an film board film when i was 10 , and it left a la@@ sting impres@@ sion , to see babies playing with kni@@ ves .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
and the religi@@ ons that should be making a major contribu@@ tion are instead seen as part of the problem .
serious problems , big problems , pres@@ sing problems .
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
and then you can take the little piano circu@@ it off the pen@@ cil .
so we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in .
and those two ro@@ les came together for me in a book that i wrote called &quot; orig@@ ins . &quot;
she gets into the car -- she &apos;s sitting on two phone books .
we want you to walk up the h@@ ill in another two days &apos; time .
so while you &apos;re sitting around with the other patients in your pa@@ jam@@ as and everybody &apos;s p@@ ale and thin and you &apos;re waiting for your turn to get the gam@@ ma ra@@ ys , you think of a lot of things .
ar@@ iel : i bo@@ ar@@ ded the king &apos;s ship . in every cab@@ in , i fl@@ am@@ ed ama@@ z@@ ement .
i took it very literally , and took my bi@@ ke hel@@ met , put a little cut over there so that the proje@@ ctor actually f@@ its ni@@ c@@ ely .
and from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in rever@@ se .
now , to make this more con@@ cre@@ te , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out in the most favorite ted@@ talks and in the least favorite ted@@ talks .
richard sau@@ l wur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at pen@@ n .
have got these sur@@ ve@@ ys in place in their dat@@ ab@@ ase , then they use advanced mathematical for@@ mul@@ as to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
it is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or blind that the process is inter@@ rup@@ ted .
she was the c@@ bs news cor@@ respon@@ dent who was bru@@ t@@ ally sex@@ ually as@@ sau@@ l@@ ted in eg@@ y@@ pt &apos;s ta@@ hri@@ r square right after this photo was taken .
they have a sense of the great ar@@ c of time and their tiny place in it .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most cru@@ cial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being pollu@@ ted by agri@@ cultural , industrial and hou@@ se@@ hold chemicals that still are being spra@@ yed around the world , seem@@ ingly with the in@@ ability to profit from past experience .
perhaps loss of memory is so cru@@ cial for our survival as human beings .
now , some people call her the first program@@ mer .
so once those pictures are ac@@ qui@@ red and the physi@@ cian has dra@@ wn all the necessary safety limit@@ s and so on , he sel@@ ec@@ ts basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cur@@ sor is -- and he pres@@ ses this blue butt@@ on called &quot; son@@ ic@@ ate . &quot;
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bul@@ le@@ tin .
no ce@@ o , no fir@@ m responsible , sing@@ ly , for building it .
like those big explo@@ sions , spar@@ ks , are from a little com@@ b j@@ el@@ ly , and there &apos;s kri@@ ll and other kinds of cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans , and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
and , la@@ stly , under &quot; harmon@@ y , &quot; they had this 13@@ th-@@ century mand@@ ala from ti@@ bet .
nasa suppor@@ ted this work 12 years ago as part of the re@@ building of the ha@@ y@@ den planet@@ ari@@ um so that we would share this with the world .
in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , for example , there were just about a do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , most of whom lived and worked in har@@ are city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
the women &apos;s ch@@ ie@@ f of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dir@@ ty .
but it is changing the equ@@ ation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decisi@@ on-@@ making .
it thought of itself as being dis@@ connected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle a us@@ b drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destro@@ y themselves .
that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own class@@ rooms , and they pick the lessons they want to sub@@ mit , a lot of them will be e@@ ager to participa@@ te .
it was 23 me@@ tri@@ c tons for one li@@ ter .
it comes off the ocean here and is dra@@ wn up towards india .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a scre@@ ed .
but the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , the same way it ag@@ gre@@ gates sar@@ gas@@ sum we@@ ed , actually is pul@@ ling in the plastic from throughout the region .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insi@@ ghts of con@@ temporary psychology .
they can get basic u@@ tili@@ ties like electricity .
how can you use this stuff ?
we &apos;re very co-@@ evolved , because we dep@@ end on bees for pol@@ lin@@ ation and , even more recently , as an economic com@@ modi@@ ty .
and look here -- compare to the phili@@ pp@@ ines of today .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to susta@@ in itself .
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual inter@@ ro@@ gation .
we did this with the great tur@@ tle race -- tag@@ ged tur@@ tles , brought in four million hits .
when i stood there in the gr@@ ass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this wa@@ ving gr@@ ass .
and when that cell@@ ular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly char@@ ged proteins and al@@ ig@@ ns them .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capit@@ alized . not that it &apos;s become less capital inten@@ sive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s requi@@ red -- but that the ow@@ ner@@ ship of this capital , the way the capit@@ alization happens , is radi@@ cally distribu@@ ted . each of us , in these advanced econom@@ ies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you &apos;re only shif@@ ting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regul@@ arly .
you &apos;ve believed it through generations .
then mon@@ arch@@ y had seen off its big challen@@ ger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but do@@ om@@ ed experiment , just as capit@@ alism has seen off soci@@ alism .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever@@ -@@ ever@@ -@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but susta@@ ined , above all , by pl@@ ur@@ alist democracy .
and what i &apos;d like to do is take you up to the can@@ op@@ y , not by putting all of you into rop@@ es and har@@ n@@ esses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called &quot; hero@@ es of the high fron@@ tier . &quot;
we need a nas@@ a-@@ like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be explor@@ ing and prote@@ cting our life support systems here on earth .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stu@@ ff@@ ed spin@@ o@@ za , but we do have a stu@@ ff@@ ed pa@@ v@@ lo@@ v &apos;s dog , and i vis@@ ited him in the museum of hy@@ gi@@ ene in st@@ . pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , in russi@@ a .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
but in a small col@@ ony , it &apos;s likely to meet fewer for@@ a@@ gers , just because there are fewer other for@@ a@@ gers there to meet .
and we take car cr@@ as@@ hes for gran@@ ted .
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in h@@ ong kon@@ g that most of trans@@ mission was because people were re@@ moving their mas@@ ks impro@@ per@@ ly .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere .
well , what i did with that was to access the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stics liter@@ ature .
there is a basic view that real value invol@@ ves making things , invol@@ ves labor . it invol@@ ves engineering .
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a ser@@ vi@@ ce-@@ based economy .
and a social movement is com@@ pris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of four main characteri@@ stics .
our ne@@ west experiment has been hat@@ ched by my collea@@ gue , art ar@@ on -- putting people who are repor@@ ting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the func@@ tional mr@@ i .
i &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely mis@@ er@@ able people , and i &apos;ve asked the question , how do extremely mis@@ er@@ able people diff@@ er from the rest of you ?
so it rema@@ ins for me to com@@ ment on the ways in which chimpanze@@ es are so like us , in certain aspe@@ cts of their behavior .
what howard did is he fundament@@ ally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
as we try to build this view , and try to educ@@ ate ourselves about the enor@@ m@@ ity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigan@@ tic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trilli@@ ons .
but i wasn &apos;t into selling wh@@ is@@ key ; i was into selling ice .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ fl@@ at@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logi@@ cal shape on the inside of a ca@@ ve , fo@@ am@@ e@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ lo@@ cks to deal with this complex to@@ po@@ log@@ y , various ways of getting brea@@ thing g@@ ases made from the in@@ trin@@ si@@ c materials of these bodies .
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
so when i click on &quot; sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic , &quot; i get sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreci@@ ate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between compe@@ ting goods .
these are cam@@ els moving across the ri@@ ft valley in africa , photograph@@ ed by chris john@@ s .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gri@@ d@@ lock .
we realized that when plasti@@ cs get to the du@@ mp , it &apos;s difficult to sort them because they have similar den@@ si@@ ties , and when they &apos;re mix@@ ed with organic matter and construction de@@ br@@ is , it &apos;s truly impossible to pick them out and environ@@ ment@@ ally elimin@@ ate them .
i want to point out a few other ex@@ cep@@ tional people in this picture .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concern@@ s , tend to be isol@@ ated individuals .
you send a comm@@ and down , it causes mus@@ cles to contra@@ ct .

the date was febru@@ ary 2000 .
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x looks like in my living room .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
and number two , do not build a re@@ former on the ocean .
and then they benefit through the ex@@ pos@@ ure , adverti@@ sing and lin@@ ked sal@@ es .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circum@@ stances : living with in@@ tent .
this is perhaps the most primi@@ tive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a sti@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ mu@@ d hu@@ t next to a g@@ arb@@ age hea@@ p .
but i get a lot of toi@@ lets , and so you just dis@@ pat@@ ch a toi@@ let with a ham@@ mer , and then you have l@@ um@@ p@@ y ti@@ les .
now , here is another nai@@ ve adverti@@ sing man &apos;s question again .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um goal &apos;s target of hal@@ ving the number of people without access to safe drin@@ king water .
my father , who had f@@ ought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
and things can happen only if these inter@@ actions are perfectly bal@@ an@@ ced .
we believe that in a one-@@ hour flight we can re@@ write the text@@ book on mars by making high-@@ resol@@ ution measu@@ re@@ ments of the atmosphere , looking for g@@ ases of bio@@ gen@@ ic orig@@ in , looking for g@@ ases of vol@@ can@@ ic orig@@ in , studying the surface , studying the magne@@ tis@@ m on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a do@@ zen other areas .
their decisions , their actions matter .
this was -- this is south of the ant@@ arc@@ tic circle .
i want to see fish pon@@ ds in par@@ king lots and bas@@ ements .
it invol@@ ves light con@@ es and quant@@ um ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ment , and i don &apos;t really understand any of that .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
the in@@ do@@ -@@ european ro@@ ot of the word hope is a stem , k-@@ e-@@ u -- we would sp@@ ell it k-@@ e-@@ u ; it &apos;s pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced ko@@ y -- and it is the same ro@@ ot from which the word cur@@ ve comes from .
the internet is the first medium in history that has na@@ tive support for groups and conversation at the same time .

these three systems are coming together , allo@@ wing people to share resources without sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ cing their lifest@@ y@@ les , or their cher@@ ished personal free@@ dom@@ s .
this is the world development inde@@ x indi@@ c@@ ator data in the early 199@@ 0s .
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of shor@@ t-@@ term work@@ force to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pi@@ p@@ eline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clin@@ ic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human sym@@ ph@@ ony .
and these two war against one another almost continu@@ ously .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent pen@@ et@@ ration in the market that it ser@@ ved , which is over 5@@ 0,000 people .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed ri@@ ght-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
the standard explan@@ ation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary energy -- which ble@@ w it up .

there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more re@@ venue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .

perhaps in conver@@ gent mode we need to be more serious .

and although i want to thank the tal@@ ented people of our company fore@@ most for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of lu@@ ck and ti@@ ming -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
i &apos;m going to show you how terror@@ ism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
but this is the result of a very care@@ ful brand@@ ing and business strategy .
he appar@@ ently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profi@@ le .
so this is how this sche@@ me would look .
from there i started with sky@@ di@@ ving .
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabili@@ zing the mi@@ cr@@ o economy .
in the mean@@ while , let me conclu@@ de the first part of my show by doing something a little tri@@ ck@@ ier .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of all antibio@@ tics consum@@ ed in america is consum@@ ed in animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
normally we think about technology as inter@@ active .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circu@@ it board on the other side .
we paid them 10 cents per cor@@ rect question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per cor@@ rect question .
notice also that on all of these graph@@ s , the slo@@ pe is ste@@ e@@ per on in-@@ group , auth@@ ority , pu@@ ri@@ ty .
it is , argu@@ ably , the most au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous en@@ dea@@ vor of that ed@@ war@@ di@@ an golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from sc@@ ur@@ vy to solar pan@@ els , that it was high time someone had a go at fin@@ ishing the job .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accep@@ ted the job , and then she almost ran away scre@@ aming .
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communic@@ ations patterns using a lot of these tools . and dou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attac@@ ks of last week .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few cent@@ u@@ ries , or even decades , started to cul@@ tiv@@ ate an image of a my@@ th@@ ical , rural agri@@ cultural past .
but i was at a ted event recently and es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
we don &apos;t have a neu@@ tra@@ l word for it .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
they &apos;ve gone out to do different tas@@ ks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest ent@@ r@@ ance determin@@ es , or influ@@ ences , each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to per@@ form .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 198@@ 4 to be able to discover this virus ?
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
the fra@@ ction of those which get a first repli@@ c@@ ator .
so what you see here is 12 separate pe@@ t@@ als , that each could be controlled with individual micro@@ process@@ ors that would only cost a dollar .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to col@@ oni@@ z@@ ers and im@@ peri@@ alists .
those are then sel@@ ec@@ ted by the algorith@@ m , re@@ produced with mu@@ tation and re@@ combin@@ ations to introdu@@ ce sex as well .
we st@@ um@@ bled on it , looking for some missing heat .
one of the more tou@@ ch@@ y political subje@@ cts in b@@ hu@@ tan is the use of indian cheap labor that they im@@ port from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
they down@@ lo@@ aded it from dis@@ ne@@ y@@ .com , or one of these web@@ sites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &apos;s a personal relationship to expression that is l@@ ac@@ king in the technologi@@ cal sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to per@@ form .
it &apos;s the 24@@ -@@ hour roll@@ ing african news chan@@ nel .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
so what we had them do was memor@@ ize this lo@@ wer@@ -@@ left sound ic@@ on , please .
they didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff higher up the pyrami@@ d .
where &apos;s the line that mar@@ ks that ?
in other words , i look for ali@@ ens , and when i tell people that at a cock@@ tail party , they usually look at me with a mil@@ dly incre@@ dul@@ ous look on their face .
and i want to begin with one ep@@ iso@@ de from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar &apos;s fe@@ ast -- because we &apos;re talking about the ir@@ an-@@ iraq war of 5@@ 3@@ 9 b@@ c .
the third thing on my che@@ ck@@ list is rela@@ tions with neighbor@@ ing friend@@ ly societies that may pro@@ p up a society . and if that friend@@ ly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the green@@ land nor@@ se , they had trade with the mother country -- nor@@ way -- and that trade d@@ wind@@ led : par@@ tly because nor@@ way got we@@ ak@@ er , par@@ tly because of sea ice between green@@ land and nor@@ way .
i happened to buy that mot@@ el about three months after vi@@ vi@@ an started working there .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the govern@@ mental decisions , discus@@ sions of the coun@@ cil of mini@@ sters , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the coun@@ cil discus@@ sions took place .
i esti@@ ma@@ ted that , just today , across the world , we spent about 10@@ 6 average world life@@ times teaching people how to calcu@@ late by hand .
but we are enter@@ ing an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of co@@ s@@ me@@ tic standards .
and my imm@@ un@@ ologist told me that i should also wi@@ pe down all of the remote contro@@ ls and i@@ phones in my house , because those are just or@@ gi@@ es of ger@@ ms .
well , at least i can clean this wo@@ und and was@@ h it . &quot;
we pu@@ mp the flu@@ id through one of these systems , and we press the butt@@ on , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the genom@@ ic character .
world population , p@@ c plac@@ ements , the archi@@ ve of all the medical liter@@ ature , mo@@ ore &apos;s law , the old way of sequen@@ cing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff .
and it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done to look fairly serious .
j@@ w : so is english man@@ ia good or bad ?
there &apos;s something almost quite ma@@ gical about visual information .
what would this lead to ?
so who is god , if not the great pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t-@@ master or the tri@@ b@@ al prote@@ ctor ?
okay , part one starts back in 19@@ 29 when the great astronom@@ er ed@@ win hu@@ b@@ ble realized that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all rus@@ hing away from us , establi@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ching , it &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing .
&quot; many do not know the alp@@ hab@@ et or multi@@ pli@@ cation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ tic@@ ut scho@@ ol@@ teacher .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not a solution of s@@ alt and water , but rather s@@ alt that &apos;s mel@@ ted .
i think of the great indian mathemati@@ cian , ra@@ manu@@ j@@ an .
what can the red@@ wo@@ ods tell us about ourselves ?
my experience , however , in the islam@@ ic world is very different .
this is an astro@@ lab@@ e . pretty impres@@ sive , isn &apos;t it ?
so this means that , with each eur@@ o he invest@@ ed , he was able to move 26 euro@@ s of market value through the chain of ow@@ ner@@ ship rela@@ tions .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my simpli@@ city lab , it &apos;s pretty un@@ intelli@@ gi@@ ble .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldi@@ er with this gun .
and here you can see how they really cra@@ f@@ ted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quanti@@ ta@@ tive , as well as qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative , metho@@ ds to come to a final solution that is truly integr@@ ated and completely ho@@ li@@ stic with the architecture .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produ@@ ces a mush@@ room -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
now mathemati@@ cians have ans@@ wer@@ ed that question .
because we &apos;ve solved the problem in ch@@ u@@ but pro@@ vin@@ ce , which is like a state in ar@@ gent@@ ina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &apos;s about 1,000 kilometers of co@@ ast@@ line -- but we haven &apos;t solved the problem in northern ar@@ gent@@ ina , ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay and brazil .
if you do come to cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , you will probably see an instal@@ lation by ai wei@@ we@@ i , the chinese artist .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ ology to make a pre@@ ven@@ tive flu v@@ acc@@ ine .
it was at this point that events began to rapi@@ dly over@@ take me .
and the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fa@@ ke fi@@ xes .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .
and i was actually a po@@ tent force in spre@@ ading ideas across bor@@ ders , and i wit@@ n@@ essed the rise of islam@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m as distin@@ ct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influ@@ enced my co-@@ religi@@ oni@@ sts across the world .
but you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
that fix@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with a me@@ al -- changes .
i &apos;ve been told by the revolution of military aff@@ air@@ s crowd for years , we can do it faster , che@@ aper , smaller , just as le@@ th@@ al .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mu@@ tation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social invest@@ ing .
he very carefully and me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously notes his results in an exercise book .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and ko@@ ko , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ ru@@ m@@ bau@@ gh and kan@@ z@@ i , pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a , ir@@ ene pe@@ p@@ per@@ berg , ale@@ x the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
all they had was mi@@ ke &apos;s hard le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent al@@ co@@ hol .
now , i was taken by in@@ spec@@ tor brian can@@ ter@@ a , of the ro@@ y@@ al can@@ adi@@ an moun@@ ted police , to a ca@@ vern@@ ous war@@ e@@ house east of van@@ cou@@ ver to see some of the goods which are regul@@ arly con@@ fis@@ cated by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market for b@@ .@@ c. bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s market@@ ed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
our school would show bill n@@ ye the science guy .
i work with some of the most amazing people .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and sometimes that can be different amo@@ unts over different times or with different people or on different days .
so it &apos;s actually a multi-@@ dimensional user interface .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible vari@@ ation in the components .
anthropo@@ log@@ ist wa@@ de da@@ v@@ is mus@@ es on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of the el@@ der brothers , a group of si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada indi@@ ans whose spi@@ ritual practice hol@@ ds the world in balance .
how do you get from poverty and corruption to wealth and less corruption ?
then you notice that if that le@@ go@@ -@@ provi@@ ded c@@ ad program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-@@ source , thir@@ d-@@ party , independent le@@ go c@@ ad program that lets you do 3d mod@@ el@@ ing and 3d ren@@ der@@ ing and make , in fact , movies out of le@@ go , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mi@@ mi@@ cking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people re@@ creating all sorts of things .
some of these have already been tou@@ ched upon by other speak@@ ers , which is encoura@@ ging .
with a screen it could in@@ form people or show them around in a fun and entertain@@ ing way .
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was cele@@ br@@ ated in europe , in germany , and the cele@@ br@@ atory pres@@ ent@@ ations were given in english acc@@ ents , and american acc@@ ents , and ger@@ man acc@@ ents , and french and itali@@ an and du@@ tch acc@@ ents .
and we per@@ si@@ sted , and we got 4@@ 50 guys growing mu@@ sta@@ ches , and together we raised 5@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars , and we don@@ ated every cent of that to the pro@@ state cancer foundation of australia , and that repres@@ ented at the time the single biggest don@@ ation they &apos;d ever received .
king of diam@@ on@@ ds . l@@ g : ah !
again , we are making holes in the sk@@ ul@@ l about the size of a di@@ me , putting an electro@@ de in , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down to a pac@@ e@@ maker in the ch@@ est , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can ad@@ just how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
g@@ uns are not a part of our lives .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pir@@ ou@@ et@@ ting through the ice r@@ ings of saturn .
i can look at your financial recor@@ ds .
as you go from 0@@ .@@ 1 to 0@@ .@@ 2 , it becomes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh at the end .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappe@@ ared into the sha@@ do@@ ws , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
and this doesn &apos;t even account for the foot@@ print on the ground .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .

you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn about computers ?
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
and that somehow , predi@@ ction leads to intelligent behavior .
there &apos;s that di@@ p there for the 19@@ 18 flu .
however , our e@@ ars tell us a very different story .
the first one is de@@ dic@@ ated to spen@@ cer , and his grandmother , who was sho@@ cked by his work .
a@@ o : you did teach yourself to play , and as a con@@ sequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
un@@ accep@@ table . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
you can recognize them inst@@ antly by their fantastic shapes .
you can try it .
for example , g@@ arb@@ age dis@@ charge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regul@@ ating ship dis@@ charge of g@@ arb@@ age actually get we@@ ak@@ er the further you are from sh@@ ore .
bru@@ ce a@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . j@@ on , polio &apos;s almost been er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated .

in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
and suddenly she sees a t@@ ank am@@ bling down the main road of sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo kno@@ cking everything out of its path .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
where does medical ability end and start ?
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
&quot; the human voice : myster@@ i@@ ous , spon@@ tane@@ ous , pri@@ mal . &quot; with these words , sop@@ ran@@ o c@@ lar@@ on mc@@ fa@@ dden invi@@ tes us to explore the myster@@ ies of brea@@ thing and sing@@ ing , as she per@@ forms the challen@@ ging &quot; ari@@ a , &quot; by john c@@ age . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , the first set of path@@ ologi@@ es , they end up in the stick man on his ic@@ on , but the rest of them are really what &apos;s important here .
a techni@@ cian will put the electro@@ des onto the sc@@ al@@ p using a conduc@@ tive gel or pa@@ ste and usually after a proce@@ d@@ ure of prepar@@ ing the sc@@ al@@ p by light ab@@ r@@ asi@@ on .
what about resources ? how are we going to feed nine billion people ?
what she found was many of these stories tend to bl@@ ame vic@@ ti@@ ms and de@@ value their lives .
near that was me@@ than@@ e . i &apos;ve never seen vol@@ can@@ o@@ es of me@@ than@@ e .
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of a spi@@ der named char@@ lot@@ te , silk is terri@@ fic .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear a t@@ one -- and a flas@@ h of light occur@@ red there .
move it .
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , progra@@ mm@@ ers , wri@@ ters , engineers , thin@@ kers -- that people really need long stre@@ t@@ ches of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted time to get something done .
these films held what was too hur@@ t@@ ful to say out l@@ oud , and they became more useful to me than the wh@@ is@@ pers of survi@@ vor@@ s and the occasi@@ onal gli@@ mp@@ se of a tat@@ too on a ma@@ i@@ den a@@ unt &apos;s wr@@ ist .
we basically are taking the same satelli@@ te phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chi@@ ps .
and i decided the reme@@ dy to all this mal@@ a@@ ise was going to be for me to ch@@ ase an el@@ ev@@ ated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require u@@ tter con@@ vi@@ ction and un@@ wa@@ vering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspe@@ ct of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of con@@ vi@@ ction .
this rei@@ ter@@ ation is a huge flying bu@@ t@@ tr@@ ess that comes out the tree itself .
would he need the same language as a law@@ yer , for example ?
and just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from liquid to soli@@ d depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being un@@ conscious , depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp r@@ ory ste@@ wart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democra@@ cies are deeply cor@@ ru@@ pt ; mean@@ while , 8@@ 4 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , ste@@ wart sounds a call to action to re@@ build democracy , starting with recogni@@ zing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ide@@ al .
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingre@@ di@@ ents from back@@ y@@ ard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families s@@ lau@@ ghter pig@@ s and extra@@ ct the ingre@@ dient .
so mot@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activ@@ ated on the motor cortex .
so , un@@ fol@@ ded it &apos;s about 300 lin@@ ear feet .
now , africa is the most tro@@ pic@@ al continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and cap@@ ri@@ cor@@ n -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of gl@@ aci@@ ers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
human@@ -@@ forced climate change alone -- again , if un@@ ab@@ ated -- could elimin@@ ate a quar@@ ter of survi@@ ving species during the next five decades .

the more that robots ing@@ rain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &apos;re forced to exam@@ ine ourselves as people . at tedx@@ ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , ken gold@@ berg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working with robots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &apos;re listening to other wh@@ ales and modi@@ fying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hearing , just like song birds or the dolph@@ in whi@@ st@@ les i described .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fri@@ es , and scan@@ ned them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to auto@@ matically lay out fren@@ ch@@ -@@ fr@@ y images .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
but there was also many chri@@ stian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
now the interesting thing is , repu@@ tation is the soci@@ o@@ economic lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant that makes collabor@@ ative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be gener@@ ated from , and its appli@@ cations , are far bigger than this space alone .
ed ga@@ vag@@ an : a story about kn@@ ots and surge@@ ons
opened a theme park through a licen@@ se in ku@@ wait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 square feet , 20 ri@@ des , all with our characters : a couple back@@ -@@ to-@@ school licen@@ ses in spa@@ in and tur@@ key .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often the ne@@ anderth@@ al mat@@ ches one african or the other .
i grew up in the middle of no@@ where on a di@@ rt road in rural ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , an hour from the ne@@ ar@@ est movie theater .
the sen@@ sor would have to be in@@ expensive , ra@@ pid , simple , sensitive , sel@@ ec@@ tive , and minim@@ ally invasi@@ ve .
i think there &apos;s a kind of meta@@ physical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of w@@ all@@ ing ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
so what this figure shows is that spi@@ ders date back to almost 3@@ 80 million years .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quant@@ um theory of space and time and gravity , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
so we got some land that was don@@ ated by a local garden center .
some of the teen@@ a@@ gers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
the te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic pl@@ ates of world politics were shif@@ ting .
right now , it feels like i for@@ got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gra@@ y and it seems like the world is sp@@ inning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am sp@@ inning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the now everybody s@@ ings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the thank you .
so this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ els portra@@ y the ti@@ mel@@ ess truth that order ten@@ ds to deca@@ y .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , my first conf@@ ession -- to a base@@ ball@@ -@@ lo@@ ving pri@@ est !
it took me several months to design the colum@@ n , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calcu@@ late all of the 16 million faces .
the class@@ rooms have no walls .
she ended up underneath the car .
and it been growing for about 600 years .
and then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dama@@ ging the cortex , allo@@ wing these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fl@@ aming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ ex@@ pli@@ c@@ ably you find yourself being sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
and what you will find is a very , very low-@@ ran@@ king bit@@ ch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-@@ ran@@ king male .
ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur w@@ inner sen@@ d@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ a@@ than uses the l@@ ens of behavi@@ oral economics to study a tri@@ cky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child dea@@ ths due to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , how to prevent diab@@ et@@ es@@ -@@ related blin@@ dness and how to imple@@ ment sol@@ ar-@@ cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?
even if they did their jobs , and they c@@ ited those facili@@ ties for their viol@@ ations , the fine would be der@@ is@@ ory .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theor@@ em , which is a truly sub@@ tle and interesting pro@@ of , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the rema@@ ining un@@ known ter@@ rain will be char@@ ted in the future .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , b@@ end their legs at the k@@ ne@@ es , if they come with that fe@@ ature , and fix them into the tiny woo@@ den cha@@ irs .
beautiful sh@@ ell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and cra@@ f@@ ts fair , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
basically i &apos;m recor@@ ding one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chron@@ ologi@@ cally comp@@ il@@ ing these one-@@ second tiny sli@@ ces of my life into one single continu@@ ous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing rate , and that 25@@ 0,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfectly .
these are also called mes@@ h networks .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ales .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reve@@ al this data anymore , so i had to make some esti@@ mates based on various sources .
the school teachers weren &apos;t having much fun , the spor@@ ts were very dir@@ ty or very pain@@ ful .
and of course : a ham@@ mo@@ ck for your after@@ noon na@@ p that stre@@ t@@ ches across your cu@@ bi@@ cle .
the g@@ 8 sum@@ mit pro@@ pos@@ es that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something ak@@ in to the mar@@ shall plan .
but it turns out that re@@ gre@@ t feels awful in four very specific and consi@@ stent ways .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or la@@ tin america or model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazi@@ li@@ an model ? -- but look at sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planet@@ ary bi@@ ologists hop@@ ing to find clu@@ es to life on other planets by looking at one of the har@@ sh@@ est conditions on ours .
that is , they &apos;re meaning@@ less without context : 500 billion for this pi@@ p@@ eline , 20 billion for this war .
every time i brea@@ the in , i &apos;m brea@@ thing in a milli@@ on-@@ billi@@ on-@@ billion atoms of oxygen .
i have become more and more un@@ comfortable with this perception of god over the years .
and by just pres@@ enting the sam@@ ples once more to the rat@@ s and lo@@ op@@ ing those results back , we were able to increase case dete@@ ction rates by over 30 percent .
char@@ lie le@@ d@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very artic@@ ul@@ ately about this need to bring consum@@ ers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
the viet@@ na@@ m prote@@ sts , the com@@ memor@@ ation of all that died in the pan@@ de@@ mic of aids , the mar@@ ch for women &apos;s re@@ productive rights , right up until almost the present .
and the stories they held provi@@ ded a shared experience .
the next phase it hit was dis@@ plac@@ ement .
well birds are pretty har@@ d-@@ wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supp@@ le@@ ment it , part of ben &apos;s idea is to use hom@@ ing pi@@ ge@@ ons to help train the young pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons how to flo@@ ck and how to find their way to their old ne@@ sting gro@@ unds and fe@@ eding gro@@ unds .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses that are not self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ ting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be scre@@ en@@ ed for and dete@@ cted and cor@@ rec@@ ted and avoid their acade@@ mic failure .
human demon@@ stra@@ tions , they &apos;re all no@@ is@@ y and im@@ perfect , and we extra@@ ct from them an in@@ fer@@ red task tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory and control sequence for the robot .
and then i went on to refle@@ ct , &quot; isn &apos;t it amazing , this entire dat@@ ab@@ ase , all these recor@@ dings , i &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your sister &quot; -- who arrived two years later -- &quot; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-@@ experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &quot;

no other evidence .
this subje@@ cts food to a force about 5@@ 0,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it cl@@ ari@@ fy chicken stock .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technologi@@ cal objects .
dar@@ fu@@ r may have sli@@ pped from the news head@@ lines , but the killing and dis@@ plac@@ ement there continu@@ es as well , and the she@@ er human mis@@ ery that it creates is very hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
it emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neuro@@ science .
sometimes you get a little star appl@@ ause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
why do we argue ? to out@@ -@@ reason our op@@ pon@@ ents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosop@@ her dan@@ iel h@@ . co@@ hen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- mis@@ ses out on the real benefits of eng@@ aging in active dis@@ agre@@ ement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vac@@ u@@ um , you know .
and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away .
