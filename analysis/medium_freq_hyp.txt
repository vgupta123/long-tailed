they offer it to try . 
this is our average budget . 
so there &apos;s nothing coming through . 
it was a tremendous success . 
this hope kept me alive . 
the jack of spades find . 
their voters are locally . 
i make my experiences exponentially . 
some of them are very simple . 
this person doesn &apos;t exist today . 
thank you very much . 
lg : welcome to happen . 
their children play instruments . 
this is what makes me crazy . 
south africa plays a role . 
thank you . 
but one day something happened . 
it &apos;s true for lincoln . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
delusions fake . 
pull the node . 
unpredictable dangerous . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
behavioral markers matter . 
a coat hangers . 
you &apos;re out there . 
a new life was born . 
but now one last thing . 
totally changes by people . 
thank you very much . 
this boy is called messoud . 
people didn &apos;t know anything about things . 
it has an extremely important function . 
there was no margarine . 
even this problem was too complicated . 
powerful feelings can create a model . 
because we can &apos;t solve problems . 
nm : not too quick . 
you can use it at ted . 
uff ... mini-mes . 
they would be numbers . 
it was overwhelming . 
because nobody really cares . 
schools can &apos;t be bunkers . 
but it was really brutal . 
1.6 million deaths worldwide . 
art is the highest target . 
thank you all . &quot; 
i had never seen an internet . 
because i &apos;m hiv-positive . 
this is five times the size . 
second , it drives by itself . 
in 2006 , a great year . 
momentum has grown up . 
i &apos;m not sure myself . 
but i can taste things . 
almost out of kindergarten . 
i just wanted a video camera . 
it &apos;s our invisible reality . 
you know very little about them . 
i was wrong with a lot of things . 
correct dependence on this person . 
and something else happens a lot . 
the rules are confusing . 
i want to show you this photo . 
some conspirations are real . 
the net has two components . 
so we have to adapt . 
i &apos;m going to study at aims . 
don &apos;t give up the wall . 
there &apos;s also a flip side . 
this is a huge task . &quot; 
they had some speakers there . 
this is a collaboration with stanford . 
a man comes to the psychiatrist . 
a great source of stem cells . 
thank you for listening . 
every spike gives 37 . 
but i had a lot of fun . 
we took over the movie . 
all these technologies can be used . 
but it &apos;s also true for adults . 
it &apos;s right after video games . 
it sounds totally silly . 
but people live on this country . 
there are no quick solutions . 
this story started four years ago . 
he landed under the car . 
feynman loved this story . 
i was inspired by a friend . 
he immediately understood what had happened . 
their metaphor is mobutu . 
these are my daughters . 
commentator : there he is . 
the next movement is called mobs . 
take a step for step . 
i married 26 children . 
i wish you a great conference . 
i &apos;m built for eternity . 
someone needs to have the front legs . 
it &apos;s a very powerful job . 
i love this formulation . 
they missed the imagery . 
i start with the business world . 
i fell down the face . 
so soundscape is important . 
it &apos;s approaching the zero . 
i have some questions for you . 
i didn &apos;t think that . 
here &apos;s another asteroid . 
here are some of the youngest images . 
you can email them . 
so he tried it with plan b . 
these are survivors . 
they would be below my level . 
there &apos;s another stage . 
now i have three different results . 
and then we come to this picture . 
we can see all sorts of faces . 
they &apos;re quite engaged . 
suddenly , we get to the possible . 
you don &apos;t always have to sit . 
so the fishermen start more . 
it just amazed me . 
guns are not part of our lives . 
they get so many things . 
so i had this tv show . 
it has 130 octants . 
be proud to have you . 
but i wish it would be better . 
it &apos;s a nice motivator . 
i think that &apos;s just fascinating . 
this is the current business model . 
but it borns me a little bit . 
for us , he meant freedom . 
they &apos;re farmers and factory workers . 
we did this in three steps . 
it &apos;s not covered with ice . 
let me ask you one question . 
dp : thank you very much . 
we have superstar banker . 
a photo is not enough . &quot; 
you and your kids are fine . 
unfortunately , the answer is yes . 
let &apos;s look at a clip . 
that gave me greater confidence . 
the classrooms don &apos;t have walls . 
there &apos;s a lot of different elements . 
the short answer to that is play . 
this is a 15-year-old boy . 
i was so drunk . &quot; 
we &apos;ve been interested in this for generations . 
they were together during the behavior . 
so i went from there . 
which made me feel nervous . 
this building , i was setting up in japan . 
now we have effective therapies . 
i was born in algeria . 
it goes back to the instincts . 
the date was february 2000 . 
i want to close with some quotations . 
but look at what we &apos;ve done today . 
average is 65 percent . 
everything is from very simplistic material . 
so i think it &apos;s too simple . 
every project we make a movie . 
and then finally , electric vehicles . 
but then paul went to the water . 
it has no priority . &quot; 
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s going on today . 
fg : i don &apos;t know . 
so nature has self-similar structures . 
there must be something better . &quot; 
i can &apos;t connect with you . 
&quot; he was smiled . 
we &apos;ve all heard of these things . 
she &apos;s about my friend of fuel . 
this is him without any use . 
i think this is an interesting question . 
values are a kind of facts . 
i have a global vision as a vision . 
no matter where you live in the world . 
the earth moved for both . 
they &apos;ve lost anything in the way . 
it certainly was challenging . 
i love these gallianos . 
the machine itself would start the music . 
and i like that kind of reaction . 
let &apos;s talk first about biology . 
this one is called &quot; durst . &quot; 
then , of course , the answer is 99 percent . 
i was born in new york city . 
humanity is going to describe this path . 
i ended up in every tv show . 
a print for 125 . 
but liberation costs money too . 
they resolve themselves in a few months . 
it &apos;s about the state of the planet . 
and yet nobody has listened to you . 
it was a pretty successful evening . 
that throws up all sorts of questions . 
he had an answer to it . 
i could use it alone by thinking . 
please remember the empore . 
first , she tried knitting . 
i &apos;m now 43 years old . 
the man is supposed to wait half an hour . 
i &apos;m going to show you how it works . 
and they have to reframe everything . 
this is a place called san francisco . 
it &apos;s part of our collective story . 
but you have to look at context . 
the technological revolution opens the world . 
this can be an important contribution . 
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity . 
we need to make the right moral decision . 
bb : i was born old . 
we &apos;re just trying to improve our lives . 
and then i started skydiving . 
100 years ago , we didn &apos;t know . 
they &apos;re not big for us . 
it &apos;s learning a lot from its mistakes . 
let &apos;s think about data for a second . 
but it wasn &apos;t quite that simple . 
only one at the same time is possible . 
we don &apos;t do anything with these cells here . 
most of these cities are growing incredibly fast . 
this is an amazing spreadsheet . 
we have this database of things . 
my life would not be the same thing . 
they read about it in their newspapers . 
and we define ourselves of these differences . 
there are these assistants everywhere . 
it didn &apos;t happen just a few times . 
we are obsessed with this thinking . 
we need to make this accessible to everybody . &quot; 
this is how hydrophile does a surface . 
here &apos;s the biggest challenge for innovation . 
it doesn &apos;t give us useful information . 
they get conscious and autonomy . 
they were removed from the gene pool . 
i &apos;m going to show you that . 
they &apos;re all making aspects of work . 
this was a logistic problem . 
there is no conductor . 
and by doing so , it &apos;s extremely dangerous . 
so we came up with these two rules . 
i have to point here in some ways . 
now we put the two things together . 
i work with absolutely brilliant people . 
i found the word scaffolding great . 
but in fact , it &apos;s quite robust . 
here &apos;s an example from this study . 
we want to present to you another piece . 
they couldn &apos;t just go on like this . 
but of course , scientists couldn &apos;t help . 
i just couldn &apos;t teach them . 
it &apos;s about focus and presence . 
this is a video of the prototype . 
there are graphic designers . really ? 
and yet , these dates are there . 
the whole thing was not happening tomorrow . 
&quot; poor nations need relief goods . &quot; 
and the frog mode . 
so let &apos;s filter it out . 
so much to political will . 
and europe has not been sent out . 
the poll takes longer than a day . 
the atomic bomb enters the stage . 
this is called the grandmother effect . 
but it &apos;s a great fun for kids . 
and we &apos;re all vulnerable . 
the other application has practical value . 
you might think of something supernatural . 
fortunately , we could convince congress . 
the first gentleman is a baker . 
what we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated . 
so i have to make a lot of decisions . 
that &apos;s a lot of impact for 14 words . 
and something since then came to me . 
that would be bad for economy and cities . 
so i tried to take measurements . 
that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago . 
so what i want to show you today . 
it &apos;s not just about survival . 
i didn &apos;t work very far away at the time . 
that &apos;s what i did from my life . 
only half of states is participating . 
it actually works like a big iphone . 
i &apos;m a designer and a educator . 
and let me show you what happened . 
so the seemingly impossible is possible . 
but they want to use it -- seriously . 
it was three days , four meals . 
and i talked about availability . 
and the world population will stop growing . 
he was working in a factory . 
it &apos;s used as a symbol of transformative . 
they get something slightly more complicated . 
but it was a little boring . 
everybody : i am my connectome . 
that &apos;s more with less and less . 
we also like to take them apart . 
we also need choice for people . 
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence . 
this is just one of the benefits of it . 
it &apos;s good to motivate students . 
half of them were donating on the internet . 
this is another tribal leader . 
and the mother is already at the high age . 
here &apos;s a wonderful fractal . 
is all this worked out ? no . 
we need them today to be more than ever before . 
this is the power of organic design . 
so we turn to the literature . 
we can &apos;t have an answer to everything . 
the world needs an international forum . 
this is very exciting for the musicians . 
it &apos;s flown around the world . 
these little boys are in nepal . 
and this is how he makes the map . 
the survivors were one after another . 
i want to take you on a journey . 
here &apos;s &quot; candycity . &quot; 
i know a woman who can do well . 
but we need to get architecture better . 
your baby will not be infected . &quot; 
you can really learn a language with this . 
adg : to persuade people . 
the next phase she achieved acquiring . 
there is no country in the ocean at all . 
i &apos;m also talking about christianity . 
they &apos;re all montated on my instrument . 
these were in maybe six different colors . 
this is a multimedia-tasker . 
but the mistakes went in a good direction . 
so far , we &apos;ve been working with over 300 . 
the bush administration didn &apos;t even answer . 
why ? because they want our diamonds . 
it &apos;s similar to a jet . 
it &apos;s a big challenge for the future . 
now let &apos;s look at another movie . 
but yet , we look at the parts . 
i &apos;m in the water with these fish . 
i &apos;ll come back to color again and again . 
i did exactly how she responded . 
and that &apos;s led to specialization . 
that &apos;s our job as a cosmologist . 
contagious is a good word . 
i have a series of inventions . 
chris bangle says , great cars are art . 
they get the best from both worlds . 
and we don &apos;t want to wait another hundred years . 
maybe they don &apos;t want to live just like us . 
the design of the body is a different story . 
and what &apos;s going on ? new life . 
get a job and get out of the goats . 
ts : these are durable magnets . 
but i think it &apos;s beautiful . it &apos;s not ? 
i painted it directly on the man . 
it &apos;s based on buying power parity . 
and a little kid in the back was like this . 
i want to show you a few of these today . 
and then finally , it starts again and grows . 
i met a man -- the guy on the left . 
you can just make it right in front of the ground . 
now it &apos;s a serious game . 
the foot is distributed throughout the leg . 
you want to hear it in different rooms . 
so it goes in there and stays there . 
but i &apos;m not talking about that question . 
the larvae needs to evolve very quickly . 
sherman is in the hairsky . 
now , this is the pantheon . 
and one day we went to meet a meeting . 
they go to eddy in lagos . 
i did a little calculation on this . 
it branches from the human form . 
so this is our biological approach today . 
but they don &apos;t get us directly through light . 
tumor cells can travel through the ages . 
it &apos;s the heart of medical care . 
and we also took samples of the outdoor air . 
&quot; let &apos;s read this letter to us . 
now , is there any alternatives to this ? 
and finally , the chinese attacked . 
i &apos;m flooding the dive . 
we took our attention to the problems . 
tell me what &apos;s going on ! 
and then we &apos;ll open more centers . 
and this is just a representation . 
and the snapshot goes . 
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things . 
and sequel is really a real car . 
and this is hedy lamarr . 
and they sat there for months . 
and you could put needles in them . 
so that &apos;s more or less what we expect . 
don &apos;t worry about numbers . 
and again , this is not theoretical . 
i can &apos;t emphasize that at all . 
i come from burkina faso . 
they also form one-third of our food . 
in 5,000 days , all these things have come . 
what if we look at fear differently ? 
and yet , we &apos;re talking a little bit about this . 
he helped in parol at a birth . 
and we see it over and over again . 
we &apos;ve done a lot of research here . 
so these people will be part of the solution . 
one of them is lack of buying power . 
and of course , there &apos;s an app on this . 
not 10 horses , not a hundred men ... 
i said , &quot; that &apos;s kind of a class . 
and not just crossing the ocean . 
technology represents the simple part here . 
the bumblebee doesn &apos;t even say that . 
our design is made for the language of a machine . 
china is symbolized by the kites . 
the phone doesn &apos;t have that delusion . 
now she &apos;s holding the powder sugar . 
and there are breathless apnoe . 
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret . 
what does that mean ? i have no idea . 
thomas batiuk : hi , eric ! 
it &apos;s a game with 50,000 parts . 
and the reason is , it &apos;s already done . 
these are the next two lines in the movie . 
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot; 
this is an advantage of older people . 
and now people from iran spoke to me . 
cables are &quot; pillow &quot; -- really . 
it &apos;s transparent , and it &apos;s just made for you . 
and that was not a misled feeling . 
and i actually moved to something like this . 
it would change its everyday life , right ? 
but you &apos;ve never seen this before . 
but nobody really showed it , right ? 
but there is global warming . 
for example , think about the finance world . 
doubt and fear always bounce . 
all the people around us are looking at us . 
most of these planets are candidates . 
look at the wars in rwanda . 
let &apos;s call them the killer apps . 
so what happens when this doesn &apos;t happen ? 
do you see what i &apos;m trying to do ? 
it didn &apos;t happen at all . 
i &apos;ll throw it back into your hand . 
seventy-zig percent of the population didn &apos;t want it . 
in this prescription , you also have the cost . 
skeptical , because you should question everything . 
all of these works have come out in the last 75 years . 
i took them out to the street . 
watch him ! this is steve jobs . 
and he finishes them with &quot; thank you . &quot; 
and it comes up to one million people a day . 
it doesn &apos;t seem to work very well , isn &apos;t it ? 
and it &apos;s obviously making a lot of money with this . 
i can dissolve the skin of the solo . 
i had a pretty beautiful life in indiana . 
we all have disabilities in some form . 
well , how could we live without the only ? 
the first number is three : three billion people . 
this is a site in brentwood . 
how long does it take to fill ih ? 
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for ipad . 
this is a human being down here at the wheel . 
it goes off and takes this model further . 
so they &apos;re allowing light anywhere in the house . 
the person on the left is a sure case . 
what are these noises ? do you ask ? 
and it &apos;s terrible windy over there . 
we &apos;re talking about thousands of suppliers here . &quot; 
and that &apos;s where i saw this : a lot of fish . 
all we got is roomba . 
this is the store during the afternoon . 
i write programs that fit to the world today . 
and most importantly , what causes these clusters ? 
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians . 
&quot; do you want to try it , france ? &quot; 
and she said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned something today . 
in north korea , i created them myself . 
we started exploring in other areas . 
and she said , just tell you about yourself . 
it was the world &apos;s first geese computers . 
how should i ever experience who are the best ? 
it represents five segments . 
voice 2 : it &apos;s over with neighborhoods . 
it &apos;s completely silent and environmentally friendly . 
and i looked at them under the microscope . 
and this noise is the latest thing . 
it &apos;s also a moment of self-knowledge . 
the idea is called social impact bond . 
the dolphin is on the keyboard . 
i need information , and i need a container . 
this is the key word -- &quot; create . &quot; 
without hearing , they &apos;re not here anymore . 
they &apos;re building their own markets and hospitals . 
but it has a lot of potential at the same time . 
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research and application . 
and people thought , &quot; you &apos;re right . 
in one year , it could be two more steps . 
that means our roof has become a commodity . 
the effects of this are known and seeing everywhere . 
i &apos;m the happiest person in the world . 
i thought , this is going to be my driver . 
it was the greatest realm in the world . 
and they make half of all civil wars . 
here &apos;s an example of solving puzzles . 
so i was trying to get altitude . 
and after einstein , this energy drives the universe . 
and it also comes to the fundamental of things . 
and now the cobra is a new symbol . 
somebody stands up and says , &quot; that &apos;s important . 
it &apos;s a little scary , isn &apos;t it ? 
so children are not empty vessels , right ? 
but it will not be possible in the future . 
i call the answer &quot; antifood wege . &quot; 
this is what we see in this poppy language . 
you should always connect your life and your work together . 
so what do we do ? we keep connecting ourselves . 
but we all use them -- even the toxic ones . 
and say to tony , &quot; here we go . &quot; 
that then attracts more matter , and so on . 
we moved to michael and john whitney . 
let &apos;s compare the old to the new world . 
is it really , how economists behave ? &quot; 
all of his colleagues said , &quot; this is unheard . 
david griffin : how photography connects us 
within three weeks , it &apos;s all over the world . 
and the same pattern appeared in every conflict . 
we didn &apos;t see something similar in africa . 
and i thought about a solution to the problem . 
that &apos;s our first proposal in this field . 
efcharisto and kalinichta . 
this is another kind of work i do . 
and i want my music to be with you . &quot; 
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule . 
and parallel to my cut is my walk . 
europe had to be stored into economic development . 
we don &apos;t see the core reactions in stars . 
so he came to me and knocked on . 
you wonder what they &apos;re doing with this material ? 
my work is -- she reflects my wider . 
and that &apos;s what i do with my furniture . 
this is sort of an optical illusion , right ? 
how is it possible to do it without the brain ? 
and he &apos;s a pretty smart guy , right ? 
bc : we &apos;re entering the atmosphere of mars . 
mixed cultures . mixed cultures increase income . 
in fact , this is an old hat for crows . 
no . there will continue to be paper dictionaries . 
in arkansas , they don &apos;t even ask . &quot; 
two -- and that was the spades two , right ? 
so how do we go from where the galaxy is ? 
what happened when the pnas released that . 
did we talk about the recovery ? it &apos;s coming . 
our school showed &quot; bill nye the science guy . &quot; 
this is not just in the hebrew like this . 
this is a remote center at the university of washington . 
just fold the tracks together and drive them on . 
the point was , &quot; here &apos;s the poor professor . 
maira kalman , the educated woman . 
the constitution of the united states is the gay agenda . 
do you know , when kids do homework tasks at home ? 
but in history , it &apos;s not about those chapters . 
we set up these pieppers in the clinic . 
why is it so important that it goes fast ? 
and i &apos;m actually a little visually impaired myself . 
there &apos;s a complete orchestra in the building . 
so you take a sheet and you put it on the side . 
and nothing we do is more important to our survival . 
and that &apos;s harm . why is that ? 
and they can cost the ingredients in the school garden . 
just ask , &quot; does it serve my interest ? &quot; 
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s simplicity . 
it &apos;s called &quot; the story of the captain . &quot; 
you know what ? that &apos;s done in india . 
look at the mental resilience and how it distracts . 
can you show us what a good pilot you are ? 
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; 
every city , every district of reactions . 
who are those characters who are so damn happy ? 
but what can you update about this , right ? 
how hard will it be to find life on mars ? 
we became more social . the social network spread . 
here we have our star field . here are our shapes . 
and our joy of music , etc . ... &quot; 
everything had to be huge . the next picture was even bigger . 
in the u.s. and western europe , it &apos;s eight percent . 
hey : you always see the last place i was in . 
everything i say is -- facts . just facts . 
these are the ketads and the strings . 
the next decade is the decade of games . 
it will be free and work in every browser . 
i &apos;m a neuroscientist , and i studied physics and medicine . 
that sounds like the big brings ; we do that . 
and the other one is called taketa . which one ? 
and turning it off , it &apos;s more or less a zero . 
and these limbs , they form these mechanisms . 
once you have that , the calculations come . 
in this case , we put two chimpanzees next to each other . 
there was no cars , and somehow it seemed better . 
and all the styles were recording , and so we did it . 
if that can be melted , why not us ? 
i &apos;ll tell you how big the power is -- the size of it . 
and then you enter the living room and so on . 
he used wild birds to create art for him . 
how do you make sure it reaches them and improves their lives ? 
now , what happens ? what is a chance ? what is happiness ? 
the middle one on my kitchen table . not a big difference . 
we create meaning through vision , through an act of visual imposal . 
it extends over 800 kilometers . of course , here is india . 
and i say , &quot; kate , what do you want to do ? &quot; 
i could just breathe . i tapped air . 
so i want to end with that . these are my older people . 
this is all &#91; unclear &#93; . thank you for this possibility . 
the consequence was looked at by boltzmann in the 19th century . 
it &apos;s about their electoral district , about their business . 
now , my time runs off . so i want to sing a song . 
&quot; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &quot; 
and i read it , and it was -- it was just crap . 
look at me for a minute , and look at the whole development . 
and now you want to imagine your music video . here &apos;s ok go . 
i know the answer to that , but , how do you land ? 
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world . 
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet . 
it was very hot . i was very hungry . 
i made the head . they made the body . 
very advanced , no air conditioning -- i &apos;m excited about it . 
and my question is , how did we get it so far ? 
it &apos;s not going to affect anything . it &apos;s not at any exception . 
there are different technologies . one of them are cell phones . 
this is the mathematics of 80 rule , ok ? 
and then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot; 
and then the old ones die again , and they get two billion children . 
believe me . under bed , there &apos;s no good hide . 
i &apos;d always won everything , and now i thought , what ? 
and in them , the role models are quite great sales . 
dr. v : the concept of mcdonald &apos;s is simple . 
it wasn &apos;t a real research report , rather a tirade . 
i couldn &apos;t bring it into a lab and try it . 
we could have circular narratives that are actually round . 
there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process .

the human goal was to identify camps for settlement based on precedented need . 
and she walked into the city , and she turned off , and she said , &quot; i have to buy new shoes ! &quot;

and together , these volunteers and teachers are connected to create a new generation of global , green leaders . 
it costs 1.7 million dollars in development . it &apos;s called go , and it &apos;s from bernhardt , usa . 
if you look at it , nature doesn &apos;t know any other proportions in which functions are similar characteristics . 
when i run a film of shelves , we prepare too much every day . we think too much . 
but small atoms want to merge , small nuclei want to merge , to make bigger direction of iron . 
but compared to democrats and republicans , there is no big difference based on who are neighbors . 
and it seemed to me that even he was really bad at looking at these unorganized red squares every day . 
it can be something that might be very serious about , as i said , the human rights in birma . 
it &apos;s a story of public education and rural communities and what design can do to improve both . 
what if they could also look up to the night sky , to the same stars , but from the other side ? 
all we need to do is make a company with carbon dioxide pflault juice . 
and when he was there , we started eating him out so he could feel how gravity actually feels like . 
he flew them for the first time , he flew them for the second time , he flew them for the third time . 
so the first one is -- the most significant termin dynamics in the world -- is something called happy hour . 
but there &apos;s more good news that later came to evolution , a kind of secondary evolutionary logic . 
it tastes great within the boundaries of each country , but completely sucked if you take it anywhere else . 
this argument , i think , fascinating , as if we could bend the laws of physics a little bit so that they fit us into play . 
and so we found a way to figure it out . i got this famous ramp in action for the first time . 
the woman of the chief &apos;s chief &apos;s chief had a little girl , the main color , kind of bright like mine , and all the dirty .

but he watched as physicists and chemist suppliers of mass destruction , at the beginning of the 20th century . 
we had the feeling of setting up the wiring that would only come out of the world for many years . 
it provides spaces of sustaining structure , and it creates spaces , habitable spaces within the sand dune . 
now , i also have to tell you that last week i talked to kyle about this story , i &apos;m going to tell you this story . 
and then 92 nuclear plants that would provide the energy will fill the rest of los angeles . 
i found it strange to speculate about it as if it was a competition , about a fresh wound . 
and this argument is that we can only teach creativity if we teach children as early as possible to bring perspectives . 
the irony and tragics of our time are thinking a big part of society , science would argue about it . 
so your house is constantly busy with lecks , but it repairs them . it dries them out and so forth .

and i stood on the threshold to puberty , so i took cookies out of the dose without asking . 
licklider realized , computers can do the necessary routina to make insights and decisions . 
so , from uncomprehension , there can be great things -- that i then take a picture of , which will end up land in my work . 
we don &apos;t solve the urban problems by breaking the land into the city , but that &apos;s exactly what many of us are trying to do all the time .

after these artificial genomes have been made , the first step is simply a transplant into a cell that doesn &apos;t contain a genome . 
i was thinking about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build with biological materials , but can we do similar things ? 
and if we think of legacy , i can &apos;t imagine a more powerful one , even if your life was so short . 
so the idea was to keep the sense of being free , but to change the direction and increase the time . 
this year , this disease house becomes more than 300,000 people in tamil nadu , india , giving the sight back .

so there was a time when it was your first time that you had a green ampelwave on the back of the night . 
i grew up with traditional tales about leadership . robert e. lee , john buford , in the battle of gettysburg . 
what you &apos;re seeing here is 12 separate leaves that could be moved with individual microprocessors that would only cost about a dollar . 
the only exception is the naked , in somalia , living design of maury that never gets to the surface of the earth . 
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition is as potent as eh and as if designers were just searching inside .

it &apos;s used as a barrier to protect the tracks and the guests , and prevents that things fall on the tracks . 
three composers , 70 kilos of vegetable waste come in . really , grandiose compost . 
i &apos;m an example of what is possible when girls are born and funded by the day of their birth to the people around them . 
and so we use the food lure in the hand , and we use food because we have it to do with owners . 
from this pattern , we &apos;re already seeing particle physics at tiny scale , the way the universe works at tiny scale is very beautiful . 
if you &apos;re interested in further information , we have a website that describes this exciting and fascinating mission , and why we want to do it . 
there &apos;s another reason why we might be facing our careers , our status in the world today , fearless areas than ever before . 
if you think about what it means to learn calculating or learning to read , you actually make sense of your brain . 
it &apos;s extremely unlikely that the taliban could ever take over the country -- highly unlikely they could conquer kabul . 
here we have stepper giraffs , but through evolution , there are these forest giraffe that lives only in the congo . 
now , the old problem with climate protection is that it &apos;s expensive , otherwise we &apos;ve already started lasting with climate protection .

you know , i don &apos;t know how many you read about it , but it &apos;s not fun to read you , and often it &apos;s not fun to write anything worse . 
why ? well , our generation is getting old , we baby boomers eat healthy food and train , but what about our mind ? 
&quot; what would happen if i bought for each of these shoes , just the same pair of people who have no shoes ? &quot; 
this kind of embodies me the interconnected with the world , where everything connects to each other seems to connect all the dots together .

a signal in the brain that causes disorders , we could think of as an excitement of an electrical stimulation , like the epilepsy . 
it makes less sense that a sense of protecting poison before recording , can predict who i choose in the next presidential election .

and he rushed home . after sabbath , he was making 12 laibe sandwiches that he got to the synagogue , and he went in , and he opened the shrine , and he said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you have it . &quot; 
and this creates this beautiful glitzing thing , slowly rotating , it looks something like this . this is supposed to be closer to this beauty of the natural world , in a very creative way , so that anyone can colalize their intuition in terms of space and time . 
and once you have mobility , you can produce lots of motors , because you need more units , as opposed to steam vessels or large factories that are not necessary for so many units , so this was the engine guy from mass production , which didn &apos;t take all the other engines . 
so with the first picture , i &apos;m going to talk about the beginning of the universe , and what i call the cosmic tatoring , which is the consideration of the pencil process of creation to derive from how he played , and then the attempt to understand it . 
imagine a snowflag in your hand , and you look at it and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object , but when you heat it , it flows to a drop of water , and you can see that it was really just h2o , it was made of water . 
and when we teach listening to our schools , we can take away our listening from this very clever vessel to this dangerous , scary world that i &apos;m talking about , and bring it to a place where everybody knows the whole time -- or at least able to do it . 
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make sense of its mind and change that -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to find all the mocked sugars of the future scenarios that you enjoy most . 
and he stayed there for 1.6 million years , until that very famous fossil hunters , kamoya kimeu , walked along a little slope , found this little piece of his skull on the surface , between the tiles and identified it as hominid . 
in the green areas , the yields of corn -- just as an example -- are very high , probably the highest one in the world to find for this climate and this soil , but the brown areas are showing regions that are only 20 or 30 percent of what they should get . 
but instead of doing it with irreductions , and moving them in a different direction , i &apos;d rather focus on frank , so playing with frank in your head , your little wax man , and your attention from your outer senses to the inner . 
in recent times , this power has been solved by jobs , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant percentage , if not the majority , of humanity running around with supercomputers , connected to speeds that are larger than what we now have in broadband . 
as an adult , when i was looking at the amazing insights of penny patterson and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , irene pepberg and alex , i loved that pagei . 
our communities , rural and urban , are using the operatives of infrastructure -- things like waste reproduction , energy needs , just like the social costs of unemployment , drp outrates , incarceration rates , and the consequences of health care . 
i &apos;m interested in how things work and what they are made of , but also because i think we should have a more fineral understanding of the parts that our world is made of , and we don &apos;t know just enough about what the high-tech materalities are made of the future . 
if i asked all of you to call me your coffee brand -- a coffee guy , a chew -- that makes you all happy , and then you ask to rate the coffee , the average value on a scale of zero to 60 . 
and the service workers , for the first time , have the ability to do things and show their work successful and show it in a very counter-structive way , and they experience and show the value of their work over five to six years , not just two or three , as usual today . 
when we started with the milky project , and i didn &apos;t know that i was going to work on a desk of a shadow , and then turning people into paintings , and would paint people in a milk pool . 
this is another version . it &apos;s a solid fish , and the reason the blue is a juvenile that hasn &apos;t swallowed the acid yet , not yet recorded the green album in his body to make it energy . 
as an inspiration , it serves me that we all want to interact with other people , and all of the complicated functions i &apos;m going to be released out of it , and i &apos;m going to undergo this sort of simplified object , and show the early stages of new insights that are happening in two brains while they &apos;re interacting simultaneously . 
while a global philanthropy industry is born , and this is what happens now , you should watch the aspirations , you have to jet these old requirements over the piles , so that philanthropy will be open and large and connected , in the long run . 
collaborative consumption has developed explosion -- web-based use of cars , apartments and skills . rachel botsman examines the systems of airbnb and taskrabbit : trust , and what it calls , &quot; trust capital capital . &quot; 
but we haven &apos;t gotten to the point where you &apos;d seen something in your morning &apos;s way here , which is really seamless the two-dimensional world , where we feel comfortable with the three-dimensional sky that connects us in which i don &apos;t know how it goes -- really , time to spend . 
so , to lead another metaphor , if you think of social networks as a kind of huge fabric of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to them and them , and beyond that , this tissue is actually like an old-fashioned american blanket , and it has flickers on it , happy and unhappy flicking . 
we were freaks -- hummer handbags , ladies , curiosities , who were juggling with depression and loneliness , who were trying to cheat at solitaire and flattening their own injuries and heal at night , but at night , as the others were sleeping , we kept on the rope . 
this is called steling . it &apos;s a temperature behavior that we &apos;re showing people across the street . we jump on a towel that belongs to someone -- &quot; sorry , your towel , i know . &quot; -- and then you flip on the next , so you don &apos;t burn your feet . 
a congolese woman told me how her children had to watch her father be killed , and how she was raped in front of her eyes , and how her children saw her nine-year-old siblings was killed in front of her eyes , how they managed to do it today . 
they had given me a lot of help when i was an academic song to study riders under alcohol influence , and i was painting good opportunities . and then when i spent half an hour talking about games , it was clear that they didn &apos;t feel like playing was serious . 
imagine a country that &apos;s rich in energy resources : oil and gas , sun , wind , is missing the most vital cement : water . infrastructural fahad al-attiya talks about the extraordinary ways of making little nasty state qatar secure its water supply . 
so there we were , a nuclear physicist , an internistin , right after carrie hruska , a biomedical engineer and two radiologists , trying to engage us with the established world of mammography , with a machine that was held together by tape . 
and then i come back to the beginning , and i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit more -- hopefully i &apos;m going to convince you that in today &apos;s world , it &apos;s really very important for leaders , not just to have an idea of what &apos;s important to your company , but also having a passion for something that is significant . 
and today we have the most likely aspect of all definitions , every case for me , and it means &quot; doodling &quot; officially bummers , drinks , waste time , make meaningless signs , do something low value , meaning or meaning -- my personal favorite -- nothing . 
and in this light , for religious people , compassion also brings us to mysteriums -- it encourages us to see not just beauty , but to look for god &apos;s face at suffering at the face of a foreign face of a bright religious andersstand . 
they were working on and through global products , and companies like microsoft , google , astraceneca , general electric , philips have already recognized that they &apos;re from their bangalore-and-hyderab-r &amp; amp ; d centers are able to produce products and services for the whole world . 
during the 20th century , we witnessed stalin &apos;s adhesiences , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocides , and although the 21st century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed witnesses in darfur and daily horrors in iraq . 
and the third thing is , let me show you a collection of texts that wrote 16-year-old girls , because i wanted to know how this language has changed since our time . in idealcase , i would send this back to you today , so we could study this linguistic miracle that &apos;s playing on us . 
he takes a song called &quot; blind willie mctell , &quot; named after the flower singer , and the song is a journey through the past , through a much more dark time , but a simpler time , in which musicians like willie mctell had a few illusions of what they did . 
and you start to understand that you can get sick , you can poison yourself . you have to balance your diet . once you look closely , and i &apos;ve got everything i did in the recording of information , the production of information , looking at information in terms of view of food . 
the water -- it &apos;s probably one of the most difficult problems that we &apos;re faced with in this century , and everywhere the water is being contaminated from agricultural , industrial and greenhouse dices that are still applied to the world , seemingly unable to learn from the previous experience . 
and in the slow phrase , &quot; adagio religioso , &quot; he had built the sounds of a song that he &apos;d heard outside his window , prosperously that this was his last spring , and he imagined a future for ditta that he didn &apos;t matter anymore . 
and this is not just a kind of short-term workforce to provide patients with basic food , it &apos;s the next generation of leaders for public health care , who have spent two , three years in clin-waiting rooms , and talked to patients about their most fundamental needs . 
so , if you give institutions obstacle , and they tell you that there are other coalition opportunities , they show a behavior that has similarity with the casual ross levels of reactions to the diagnosis of a bloody death : denial , negotiating , acceptance . 
but i think that research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment with david hume , adam smith , had a better understanding of who we are -- that the reason is often weak , that our emotions are strong , and our emotions are often trusted . 
what dr. soljacic found was how to enable a bigger distance between these spules in a transformator than the size of the transformational authors , and all of this with this technology that allows you to skip a glass at the other end of a room is not similar . 
if we had evolved in a vacuum , we would expect that they would bounce on the ground at the same time , if we were bacteria , to be shrinking from the thermal movements of molecules around , that would be different , but we &apos;re also middle world leaders too large than we could feel the brownian movement . 
the x-ray technology has evolved when it comes to life-size imagery , and apart from these large laste scanners machines , not enough to provide an extensive quality of imagery and the resolution of what i &apos;d like to do with this , which is to show my pictures at a scale . 
interestingly , other neurological diseases , which are very different areas of the brain , also bundle false structured proteins , suggesting that the approach could be general , which could be not only for alzheimer &apos;s , but also for other neurologs . diseases . 
so if we can use the information that comes from this reflection reflection , we can start with a traditional facial barrier , which is the large constructions of the face and the basic shape , and decreases it through the thief information that pulls the entire structure and all the fits . 
it takes just a little bit of processing to convert this into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the amazing thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , a newspaper -- the tools are almost identical to which we just used in this demonstration . 
so , imagine structures ready for this ? and you know , this is a personal relationship to the expression that &apos;s lacking in the technological circles , and so we needed dan to do a new design process , a new design process to explore its movements and to take a look at it . 
and these animals can make very likely use , not just from the power and the energy that &apos;s stored in this particular spring , but also the extreme properties of current mechanics . they could actually use the mechanics as a second force to break up the snails . 
&quot; the human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , origin . &quot; in this words , sopranist claron mcfadden asks us to examine the secrets of breathing and singing while it carries us the sophisticated &quot; arie &quot; of john cage . 
and the lord said , &apos; you &apos;ve given your best , but that &apos;s a success . &apos; &quot; this and similar was the basis of my definition of success , which is , seal peace , being dissolved by the use of knowing that you &apos;ve been worrying to afford the best possible . 
if we look at the many , many different animals , not only to us primates , but also other mammals , birds , even beaters like kangaroo and what bats do , it shows that there &apos;s a relationship between the length of childhood and the size of their brains versus their bodies , and how smart and flexible they are . 
in this case , instead of tagummi or doritos or whatever they have in their pockets , they &apos;re adding fish -- there &apos;s a water in iceland that i &apos;ve been busy with , which is in the middle of the city . the biggest pollutancy in it is not the street pollution , but more bread of people who feed fish and birds . 
so if wr wants to understand if a planet is habitable , whether it offers life-funded conditions , we don &apos;t just want to know how much light it is and how warm it is , but what all-weather it surrounds -- those energy rays , the uv- and x-rays that go from its star and make it into high-energy radiation . 
and i decided that the only means for this condition was a hardly accessible dream to pursue the first persuasive persuasive passion , something that would take me to my best aspect of my life at every minute , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t achieve it without persuasion and conviction . 
it looks like a series of brainwaves and winds are creating a layer of shredding here , and the winds are different at the clouds layer . in the middle , between the winds , the aerodynamics are emerging . if the speed difference is right , the spikes of the clouds are surrounded and these beautiful , like fragile waves emerge vertebrae . 
i &apos;ve always felt like this rare people who are just devoting this and devoting their lives of humanity with the determination of warrior and the navy of mysticist . people like martin luther king jr , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what , as long as you are not , what you should be . 
and then we &apos;re going to get a little bit more serious , so we need to involve our cad / cams and engineers , or scientists that are familiar with the thermal properties that design , atmospherical interactions , parachutes and the same thing . they &apos;re working as a team , and they &apos;re developing a spacecraft to see if they required our demands . 
these drugs were brought to market . they were very often prescribed because heart attacks are very often occurring , and it took a long time to find that these drugs were also too sterile cases , and before we heard this warning signal , more than 100,000 people in america need to stop prescription drugs against heart muscle . 
i had basically developed a very hard explaining and complex philosophy that i &apos;m not going to go into , because it &apos;s a little too profound for all of you -- but it &apos;s about what websites are doing popular , you know , it &apos;s ... unscreen dance : like an idiot and shore , i haven &apos;t got time anymore . 
so , since we can make some interesting protocells that like us , with interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and make them light , and have interesting lifelike properties , these protocells may have something to tell us about the origin of life on earth , and perhaps they &apos;re posing a little bit of access , one of the first steps that life began on early earth has started . 
i like to give the hobbyhistorian , so i spent some time trying to figure out when the first time i was mentioned . the best , early quote i could find was david livingstone , who wrote in the 1850s as east africa was railroad , steam ship and telegraph was completely integrated in the rest of the world . 
it &apos;s used in terms of a report from 2007 from the national research council of the united states where you &apos;re trying to understand how we can search for life elsewhere in the universe , ok , especially if this life is very different from our planet . if we were to come to another planet and think there might be life , how could we recognize this life as solo ? 
again , others are pretty structurally instructive , for example , that have an impact in the social sector : collecting funds that are invested to keep youth of crime , or to help old people stay healthy and contain hospital recovery . the recovery is measuring the success of the projects that you invested in . 
i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hire captain kirk and spock for the job ; after all , they were very experienced -- but seeing as a child , my grandmother often told me that &quot; the impossible is just the possible to make no one has been trying to do enough . &quot; 
if we continue to go to the realm of the amazon , we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon , here in 1975 , and if you look very closely , there &apos;s a little white line going through , like a risky , and there &apos;s a builder out there in the middle of the ancient jungle . 
venice is falling in italy . to save it , rachel armstrong says rachel , we need to think about the architecture that is made out of inactive materials , growing out and creating an architecture that builds itself . she proposes a non-full-life material that constantly repairs and makes carbon special . 
and yet , i want to show different ways of dealing with difficulty and getting right to the point , to find so much faster -- at least faster than arthur , so we &apos;re going to start cheat the common sense of human mind , the logic . everybody is supposed to be doing it . it &apos;s like , in the 90-degree angle . not so . 
we think that with an inflated flight , we can write textbooks about mars by taking high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gas biogenic and volcanic origins , studying the magnetism on the surface that we don &apos;t understand , and also about a dozen other areas . 
it &apos;s the process that holds me a little bit about the constant concern in my life , and it &apos;s the sense of &quot; 80 percent done with the project &quot; you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not done , and you don &apos;t start with something -- that &apos;s really filled my whole life . 
just at the time when the internet became a pedagogist werkeug , i left wisconsin and went to kansas , the little city of kansas , where i got the ability to teach , in a dirty city , in kansas , where i was teaching my favorite subject policy . 
because if you poison yourself by sending the cheap , low-cost , price sales -- wal-mart -- and we &apos;ll send you all the money . then what we discover is we have what , when i was a student , we were calling you shared partial destruction . 
sam harris : yeah , well , i think i &apos;ve tried to address that in a sentence while i &apos;ve been watching time , but the question is , &quot; voluntarily , &quot; in which men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re going to be treated in a certain way , if you don &apos;t give you a constrain . 
so if we want to pursue something that spreads in a network , we would put sensors on the central side of the network , including nodes a , watching people who are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of what &apos;s going on in the network . 
under economic viewing points , the demand for any kind of art shoots through the ceiling , which is the price of the entrance in the opera , the number of books sold , the number of published books , the number of new albs , and so on can see . 
and what &apos;s even more important is because we &apos;re going to get away from oil and try to place broaders -- there are so many opportunities in this one big country , just like in many countries in africa -- what was worth considering is that there was a lot of this growth that came from the oil sector , but from other areas that had nothing to do with oil . 
even though you &apos;re looking for a drug that can stop aging , in old men like me , what you can do pretty well at the lab , if you were race to warn , is it to create human life with modified genes that would enable you to live much longer ? 
so the message is , whether you &apos;re interested in fundamental , deep exploration , or very interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or whether you want to build a search and clean robot that helps in a earthquake or save someone from a fire , or whether you &apos;re interested in medicine , we need to save the plans of nature . 
and what patient capital means is that , over the course of the last month , i understood , because the company was literally 10 days away from the evidence that her product was enough of the international standards that you needed to make coartem when she got into the worst texas crisis of her story . 
and i &apos;ve been working on this , and some others have worked on a hierarchy , how many people make like many steps , and how many interesting variables , and people are a lot more popular and older . they &apos;re mostly based on john nash , known as &quot; a beautiful mind , &quot; and it &apos;s called &quot; counter-intuitive analysis . &quot; 
and to me , that means , if you really want to rediscover the wonder , you have to look out out of your little , in fear the space of correctness and look at each other and look into the range and complexity and into the mysteries of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i have no idea . 
but it makes the realization that is different in a way between the real world of people making things and the world of people thinking about things that includes intellectual challenge : we make things as simple as possible as possible , functionally as possible and so freely as possible ? 
and as soon as they were all there , such a whole stack of these sunens that you had in the old india , he put a kind of special effect that turned them into a gigantic planetary , the wonder of the universe . everybody looked in there , and they saw the total compromise of all life universes in all universes . 
luckily , the mother of invention is still necessary , and a large part of the design work that we &apos;re on the bridges on our plane was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were connected to operate on the ground -- everything from a continuously variable distribution and a cooling system that allows us to use a machine at stop-goon , to a specially appropriate vehicle , which drives the propellers , or when you &apos;re flying the ground , or if you &apos;re on the aircraft , you &apos;re on the ground , you &apos;re going to be able to see the aircraft . 
and what i &apos;m trying to do with this is , unfortunately , the colors don &apos;t come out well -- that these little five-year-old time-year-olds that you &apos;re in , you &apos;re afraid to be interested in the last and the future generation -- parents , children -- things that you can change in the next few decades -- and they &apos;re moving in this five-year-old bubble , and if you look at the population of the vacations , if you look at the human population is twice as many times of birth of my age , more than the human population is coming from the age of the time of the human age of the age of the time of birth of the age of the age of the baby , and now you get more than my children to the age of birth . 
th : one of the reasons that makes it interesting and appropriate for me here at tedwomen is that -- well , at the appropriate dinner , it was best summarized as someone said , &quot; turn you to your desk and tell you , &apos; when the revolution starts , we support you . &apos; &apos; &quot; the truth , women are already supporting you in this topic for a long time . rael carson &apos;s &quot; with siltheo borns , &quot; our fake &apos;s future , &quot; to downtown the stone sky sky sky sky sky sky . &quot; 
we decided to do something differently , and we turned flavors that were very familiar with -- in this case , we take a carrot cake , put it in a mixer , and then we have a kind of carrot cub juice juice , and then it came into a balloon , frozen in liquid nitrogen , to make this hollow net out of carrot ice , and i sag it out , and it looks like it &apos;s a monterly helicopter web . 
the fuel , as i said , is candamics clothes with zircon-fuel fires , and in an accident like this reactor , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we haven &apos;t discovered for a long time -- but these conversations to the fuel , if the water under high pressure , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they produce and the hydrogen exploded the ability to release the byproducts of burden . 
one of the ironies of this time is that we &apos;re discussing a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , in fact , it &apos;s still a source of debate , what this black current is from matter and where it comes from . the best explanation and one of the best explanations on this subject is that these matter comes from this matter , and that those plants absorb it under millions of years , and the effects are these black rivers . 
i was introduced by inspector brian cantera at royal canadian mounted police to a hall in the east vancouvers , to see what kind of goods are commonly infected by the rcmp of jewelry who , of course , send them to the south states , where a vital market for british columbia bud is dominated , especially because it &apos;s called &quot; organic market , &quot; which is very good in california . 
i grew up in the pacific northwest , where many members of the church of jesu christ live in the last few days . i &apos;d worked with them together , and i &apos;d even worked with them , but their doctrine , i didn &apos;t know or i didn &apos;t know what they told people when they were on a mission , and apparently i was curious about it , and i said , &quot; oh , please , please come in . &quot; they really looked happy . i don &apos;t think that often happened to them . 
in the face of this , i &apos;d like to say a few words about advertising , and a little bit about my new project . this project is different than the previous one , but both promote exactly the same properties of self-learning , learning by learning , self-exploration and building communities . this project is engaging with math for all schooling , at high school . we &apos;re doing this on tablepcs , because we believe that maths should undermine everything else . 
i was walking across amsterdam , and i realized that the important thing in amsterdam was not in the design stores , but outside the road , and maybe it &apos;s a city that has been shrinked not from modernism , but has perceived its architecture and character in which bicycles are important in which people are moving and protecting themselves in the right of the pedestrians . 
they say the right thing , and whoever is elected , maybe the right thing is going to do , but i want to tell you , when i came back from kyoto with a big fortune feeling that we had a breakthrough there , and then confronted the united states senate , only one in 100 senators was willing to confirm that contract , and to ratify it , which tells the candidate what people say . 
and finally , i think , just like the worst sleeve trains in an inferno , to make sure that they don &apos;t catch fire when our child lands across the herd , including these stories of families who have overcome these extreme differences , reflect the universal experience of parent &apos;s disease , which is always on the fact that sometimes you look at your child and ask yourself , &quot; what planet do you get from ? &quot; 
mythos nr. 2 : orpheus , a fellow , a charmant near his , parylöwe , great singer , loses his favorite , fought his way into the underworld -- the only person who has done it in the underworld -- blend the gods of the world , release his beauty under a condition ; he can &apos;t look them until they &apos;re out . 
this is a paper form . and what you &apos;re seeing here is a form in the hands of a nurse of the health ministry in indonesia that goes around in the rural area , on a very surely hot day in indonesia , and she &apos;s going to knock on thousands of doors , in a period of weeks or months , she &apos;s going to hit and ask , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you a few questions . 
finally , about the 16th century , a physicus whose name theophrastus bombastus auricularis of hohenheim , called paracelsus , was a name that probably a few people here know -- -- the good old paracelsus that he could predict the scale of the convulsions by using a vast amount of conception of camps to dissolve the convulsions . 
the times when a human being , a company , or a brand , could control over their call , are over -- online gossip and many denominations mean that if you &apos;re important , you &apos;re constantly in conversation about which you don &apos;t have control . tim leberys ys ys out three suggestions to accept this control loss and even put it on him -- and use it as a push to refer to your own values . 
the third point on my checklist is the relationships of friendly neighborhoods that can support a society , and if those friendly support falls , then that can contribute to the collapse of a society . the north men in greenland powered trade with the motherland , with norway , and this trade became less partly because of norweakness , partly because of the sea between greenland and for frozen . 
but it &apos;s different than cars that have been developed so fast and arranged , the school system is actually a legacy of the 19th century , from a bismarked model of german lecture that was picked up by english reformers , and often by religious missionaries in the united states as a means of social engagement , and then in japan and south korea , as they evolved . 
the tuna team on top has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1700 tuna , bluefin , yellowfish and white tuna , all at the same time -- with carefully investigated labor that we &apos;re driving out , freshfish , they &apos;re starting with brands , they &apos;re actually seeing sensors , and then releasing . 
the public loses their faith in democracy , says the british parliamentary rory stewart . new democracies in iraq and in afghanistan are laid through corrupt . at the same time , 84 percent of brits have broken politics . in this talk , stewart calls for reinbuilding democracy , recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a means of purpose , but ideal . 
and hopefully they &apos;re also for this idea that engineers and designers are using all these different climate parameters , so it will be possible to create really good and comfortable air conditions , to change our thermal perception so that we can feel ourselves in an outdomain , and we &apos;re doing it with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the ground in katar , the sun . 
or -- or maybe -- in addition to the rules , we look at whether we can await with some really sophisticated incentives , even though the people we have to do with are not in our interest , it &apos;s in their interest to act in our interest -- the magical incentives that motivate people to do the right thing when they &apos;re in their own rnutz . 
so once the animal knows this : click , feed , click , fuck , click , food -- meaning that click means food -- we put it in a cage with a hole , and basically the animal learns to put its nose into the hole where the smell of the target has been placed . it makes five seconds -- five seconds for a long time for a rat . 
i think that pattern has the ability to eradicate some of the most evil powers in society , like bad manners in the restaurant , but seriously , what you see is how the aggressibility of the industrialized world has produced these -- huge masses of things -- monocultures , and i think that the preservation of cultural diversity is very important to us . 
and if you &apos;re afraid that anything like a guaranteed income is going to be eradicated to our success rates in germ , and somehow let &apos;s become voluntary , you could be interested in social mobility , one of the things that we &apos;re really proud of in the united states is now lower than in the northern european countries that have these very generous social security networks . 
this picture suggests that a radical change is produced in the way information is produced and used austauses . it &apos;s not a lot of capital intense , it doesn &apos;t need less money ; but the ownership of capital , which is how capitalization works , is radical . each of us , in this advanced economies , has something like this , or something like this , a computer . 
i don &apos;t know if you know this , but -- maybe it &apos;s different today , or you wanted to do something in particular -- but in many hospitals in the country , you could , according to a book of jessica benjamin , until recently , read about the children &apos;s little boys , &quot; i &apos;m a boy . &quot; and the hint told about the little girl , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . &quot;
