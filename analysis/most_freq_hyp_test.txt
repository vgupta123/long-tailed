mo : data . 
highways . 
move . 
thank you . 
wonderful engine . 
data is relationships . 
thank you . thank you . 
kt : no . 
it was terrible . 
ideas about women . 
the bride . 
there was hollywood . 
very hard . 
good afternoon . 
thank you . 
this is what goes . 
tedx . 
don &apos;t make sense . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
all right . 
529 . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
no thing . 
my technology . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
good afternoon . 
he &apos;s dying . 
she &apos;s really . 
all right ? good . 
here we go . 
they never have that . 
oh , wonderful . 
and then , finally ... 
no further proof . 
think about war . 
thank you , thank you . 
i don &apos;t think so . 
that was 2007 . 
it was incredible . 
goodbye . 
so thank you . 
what &apos;s done . 
all right , further . 
so , okay ! 
there it is . 
you &apos;re happy . 
an amazing woman . 
the opposite was happening . 
i was seven . 
don &apos;t ask . 
that was incredible . 
here are some numbers . 
without the sex . 
one in 100 . 
it was fantastic . 
it &apos;s wrong . 
smart , right ? 
ideas change states . 
three different options . 
this is a city . 
he was obsessed . 
everybody &apos;s welcome . 
she was boring . 
here &apos;s another one . 
we have to change everything . 
and that makes sense . 
technology is changing . 
it &apos;s right here . 
you know the story . 
i was very moved . 
one person wins . 
this is what it looks like . 
he kind of takes everything . 
n thank you . 
companies want different things . 
audience : february . 
it &apos;s 1983 . 
everybody showed up . 
they laughed together . 
so i read slowly . 
that &apos;s how much , right ? 
they finished . 
we had plans . 
terrible , terrible . 
it didn &apos;t work . 
that &apos;s very important . 
create space for it . 
it was incredibly successful . 
i was so proud . 
secondly , economic growth . 
almost everybody sees tv . 
ok , six of them . 
you know it already . 
and not interesting about that . 
all of this is over . 
and this is what &apos;s happening . 
you see it all the time . 
that was amazing . 
so edv started . 
that &apos;s the biggest one . 
this is where we are today . 
but i didn &apos;t find one . 
she goes bicycle . 
easy to bend . 
so i filmed . 
thank you , scott . 
that &apos;s the end . 
that &apos;s true . 
every school is successful . 
these are big problems . 
we would be very successful . 
girl : holly . 
that &apos;s a lot . 
i just observed . 
we have to change . 
the answer is no . 
design comes from the inside . 
thank you . all right . 
the scientists say no . 
we gave back something . 
he saw talent differently . 
now everything is possible . 
so i showed it to him . 
thank you very much . 
we tell ourselves stories . 
so let &apos;s start . 
we &apos;re late . 
the energy is free . 
through the mother-milk . 
that &apos;s the breakthrough . 
thank you very much . 
they &apos;re all different . 
it &apos;s really serious . 
and now from 2012 . 
it was all these things . 
they just don &apos;t move . 
i like to get in . 
you knew it . 
yes , contrast . 
let &apos;s try it again . 
but they were empty . 
wish i could . 
god bless you . 
that changed my life . 
anyway , it goes on . 
science is clear . 
not from silicon . 
bring it back up again . 
it &apos;s too late . 
everybody knew the answer to it . 
the majority of people . 
but it moved me . 
i brought it with me . 
this is the death star . 
and he was agreed . 
the navigation is hard . 
it &apos;s a simple answer . 
you know that , right ? 
so , great tragedy . 
i took them aside . 
that &apos;s two days ago . 
there &apos;s only one problem . 
it wasn &apos;t bad . 
audience : 6. 6 . 
it &apos;s this pyramid . 
glamour and wealth . 
and that influenced me . 
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot; 
they act compassionately . 
but that &apos;s not all . 
everything else is planned . 
because the world is big . 
but let &apos;s play with it . 
it was like a revolution . 
this is my big wish . 
it &apos;s about that big . 
it &apos;s movement and emotion . 
that was great . 
so here &apos;s the tumor . 
there &apos;s another choice . 
here &apos;s a problem . 
here &apos;s a detail . 
everything openly , all available . 
first of all , play is universal . 
and we &apos;ll get there . 
it &apos;s 400 years old . 
i want to talk about this . 
i &apos;ll come to that later . 
this picture is probably better . 
it doesn &apos;t understand the point . 
they belonged to the boys . 
and now that &apos;s what she &apos;s doing . 
it was a good experience . 
the question was , where ? 
let &apos;s say that . 
and he &apos;s got a mission . 
he fell into the coma . 
so what do you think ? 
here &apos;s some of them . 
unfortunately , she &apos;s not . 
and it has to be free . 
that &apos;s one thing . 
this system is broken . 
that &apos;s what we &apos;re used to . 
and that &apos;s after two years . 
so i &apos;m going to do it . 
this is the financial crisis . 
they don &apos;t read the music . 
thank you very much . 
every point is a person . 
even that was not enough . 
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood . 
you just don &apos;t like it . 
and we feel good about it . 
it looks like this . 
that &apos;s great , right ? 
they were suddenly active . 
that also led to nothing . 
it &apos;s immensely today . 
i know it works . 
audience : &quot; rah . &quot; 
i would have almost missed it . 
it &apos;s so uncomfortable . 
and so i &apos;m working now . 
and grew for 600 years . 
status is very important to you . 
we had to work on meat . 
and i &apos;m going to tell you about that . 
and that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s about . 
that &apos;s what i want to talk about today . 
this may be the problem . 
they &apos;re removed . 
so they &apos;re doing this . 
that &apos;s -- it &apos;s not true . 
it was a big challenge . 
and this one is interesting . 
this is my student , tony . 
so we need to get better . 
this is the year . 
it &apos;s a wonderful thing . 
there are many different shapes . 
they were literally burst . 
and that was , unfortunately , successful . 
and in 1980 , something happened . 
and this is what happened over and over . 
and this is what it looks like . 
it was deployed indiscriminately . 
income is also increasing . 
you can all do that . 
so we zoom in . 
i just plug that in . 
so , here &apos;s the picture . 
and that &apos;s exactly what i did . 
the key here is as compassion . 
they &apos;re sitting in seshounds . 
they attacked them . 
you , you can teach it . 
so , what are we doing now ? 
but it &apos;s not that easy . 
and i was part of it . 
louis kahn , yes ! 
and not all of that is bad . 
we can cure the disease . 
it &apos;s not trivial . 
i go , &quot; yeah . 
&quot; the snail . &quot; 
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot; 
i believe in real life . 
it &apos;s a commercial example . 
it sounds something like this . 
she became part of me . 
there is the continent of africa . 
it protects the birds . 
absolutely nice to do that . 
you send it to iraq . 
resolutions , smoke . 
that was a crucial mistake . 
they thought this was fundamental . 
and you see that input . 
you have to stop . end with that . 
and there &apos;s even a church . 
and then they heard the original one . 
but the benefit is enormous . 
you have to be insane . &quot; 
i &apos;m not the best one . 
it works the same way in architecture . 
so how do we improve education ? 
and bees are very true . 
i &apos;d like to show you . 
&quot; daddy , help . &quot; 
so , back to the session . 
now i know the frequency . 
thank you . jy : thank you . 
now , that &apos;s very interesting . 
and the woman had sex with it . 
it &apos;s a talent . 
they don &apos;t need the sun at all . 
it &apos;s very sports . 
you don &apos;t need anything else . &quot; 
this is a very simple example . 
it &apos;s certainly not like china . 
your decisions , your actions count . 
we go to blind dates . 
and that &apos;s not a diet . 
ts : thank you , john . 
she &apos;s in high school . 
yes ? zoi : yes . 
that &apos;s the rocket . 
but that was just a start . 
and now it falls to the ground . 
my ancestors went to the united states . 
i &apos;ll just let you read that . 
this is the responsibility of the architects . 
the piece is not that complicated at all . 
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot; 
governments don &apos;t change that . why ? 
and there will be no mistake . &quot; 
namaste . salaam . 
second , designing them interactive . 
it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true . 
again , &quot; inward out . &quot; 
for example , it stimulates creativity . 
you all know the story , yes ? 
the programmers come and go . 
yes , it &apos;s going to go on like this . 
another neuland is found . 
well done , ladies and gentlemen . 
roger , i have them . 
but that &apos;s the basis of innovation . 
and this is the beautiful thing about emotions . 
ah , mark -- serfaas . 
i accept where we are . 
and that &apos;s the sad part . 
and that &apos;s not broken up . 
that &apos;s an engineering problem . &quot; 
chromosome one , upper left . 
and there &apos;s a cold atmosphere . 
and we also have nokia . 
but that &apos;s what i do all the time . 
thank you for coming . 
and of course it becomes a circle . 
&quot; it &apos;s all good . &quot; 
we need data , no help . 
they can invent and develop . 
it brings me around . honestly . 
that &apos;s exactly what happens in your body . 
is it because i write good ? 
and i think that &apos;s probably right . 
and we knew we were right . 
but yes , there are some solutions . 
and they tried everything they had . 
of course , you got all this wrong . 
i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot; 
we looked at the tissue more closely . 
they &apos;re completely anonymous , so to speak . 
and liberia . and congo . 
in the hospital , there &apos;s anything normal . 
you see about what i mean . 
and so i came through school . 
and we had all that on tape . 
and that &apos;s actually my theme . 
let me show you what that looks like . 
they get basic goods like electricity . 
it &apos;s the most important map of all . 
open your hand . thank you . 
come here , beside me . 
i thought that just has to be enough . 
and i drew it for them . 
i say , &quot; online organization . &quot; 
but people didn &apos;t understand it . 
and i &apos;m going to show you a graph . 
and i met the dozo . 
i &apos;m going to show you what happens . 
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about it . 
i &apos;m going to ask that all the time . 
the need is the mother of evolution . 
you know , we have to go through that . 
we rarely look at the sky . 
regret , anger , grief . 
dh : wow , you &apos;ve coached . 
recording : okay , this is about this . 
ok , that &apos;s severin hacker . 
leaders are , there is a charisma . 
well , mike , thank you very much . 
maybe just maybe , maybe it would be less . 
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes . 
i believe him . i believe that too . 
and think , &quot; ha ha ha ha . 
so diabetes is one of the big diseases . 
and if you &apos;re happy , fantastic . 
people guard when other guests . 
and all of a sudden , from chaos , all right . 
and yes , the red planet is red . 
so let me tell you how this works . 
sometimes you think i &apos;m deaf . 
couldn &apos;t do it . couldn &apos;t wait . 
and that was the language of war . 
so that &apos;s the three a &apos;s . 
and we know there are more . 
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy . 
there are different ways of doing that . 
let &apos;s look at what she looks like . 
sometimes you have to lose to win . 
i didn &apos;t know what to do . 
they want to let people live in fear . 
and i thought , &quot; well , hey ! 
that &apos;s a challenge , i like that . 
and then you ask , why economists ? 
tm : oh , 10 , 11 . 
it &apos;s really cool , at least theoretical . 
that &apos;s a way of seeing things . 
it &apos;s just about having more and more . 
first of all , listen to anger . 
and i think that &apos;s a mistake . 
it &apos;s about how we feed them . 
sure , a shopping therapy could help . 
so you can imagine how this works . 
but i knew i had to change . 
that &apos;s , i think , wrong . 
but here &apos;s what &apos;s really going on . 
that &apos;s what we all need to do . 
they weren &apos;t willing to be involved in it . 
now i know you &apos;re not thinking this . 
they want us to fit in better ways . 
invested , invested , invested . &quot; 
okay . that &apos;s mt . everest . 
red means they contain . 
if they said , you know what ? 
some people say it doesn &apos;t look good . 
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment . 
and that &apos;s what it &apos;s about in the next work . 
and the same is true of the troops . 
they &apos;re skating . they &apos;re playing street games . 
i said , &quot; that &apos;s very beautiful . 
this is what i &apos;m working on right now . 
i think a lot of people have trouble with that . 
richard preston , thank you . 
i think that &apos;s how we become people . 
we have to turn it up and down . 
this is extremely practical , but less awesome . 
good for them . they make a lot of money . 
and that &apos;s exactly the symbol of our world . 
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like this . 
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read . 
i need quickly two people to help me . 
he said , &quot; you &apos;re the bridge . &quot; 
so , how big is the infinity ? 
then the united states is up here today . 
and he put the two in his office . 
i think in poland that &apos;s the same . 
and i &apos;m thinking , &quot; wait a minute . &quot; 
you have stress , you meditate a little bit . 
okay , somebody said , &quot; five . &quot; 
ok , the parachute is designed . 
so , this is basically after nothing . 
we &apos;re going to learn to make a flap . 
it &apos;s finally . harmony is infinite . 
it &apos;s too late . that &apos;s over . 
and she said , &quot; what ? &quot; 
the schools need you . the teachers need you . 
where you might have the security to play . 
it &apos;s very hard . it &apos;s very hard . 
in fact , it &apos;s like it &apos;s going on . 
these were children being born , people died there . 
well , we have an argument for this . 
we were in the mountains , 1976 . 
let &apos;s see what people think about this . 
if you don &apos;t believe me , you ask sam . 
and nano , bang , 2,000 dollars . 
there &apos;s nothing we don &apos;t know . 
you &apos;re going to be your country . you &apos;re going to be religion . 
i think information is just interesting . 
pretty much everybody else making surveys . 
okay , so a moment here , that &apos;s good . 
not acceptable . nepriemliv . 
it was a way of localizing myself . 
and that &apos;s the question that this song is asking . 
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re crucial . 
is it the corruption , the poverty or something else ? 
secondly , because we eradicated them . 
they look like , maybe they look like sunflowers . 
and is it easy to raise the money ? 
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to go anywhere . 
it would be great if the story would end here . 
hard , right ? it &apos;s meaningless . 
we &apos;re only happy when things are fine . 
pm : well , that &apos;s a good idea . 
we &apos;re going to fly where the methane is . 
one government that depends only on the population . 
one thing we get from the mother , one from the father . 
i come back up , but not for the air . 
and look at what wal-mart has done . 
oh , after you stopped paying . 
i mean , they did everything for this woman . 
granted , i was such a child . 
the thing is , this is not google . 
we have one . it &apos;s really cool . 
but it &apos;s all right . 
hello . i &apos;m hasan . i &apos;m an artist . 
i think i have to say goodbye now . 
now , try to understand this . 
now , what is the meaning of these mirror neurons ? 
so i want to talk a little bit about how it all started . 
let me tell you , the best one is . 
and i &apos;ll show you what we &apos;ve developed . 
i think architecture is actually based on it . 
that &apos;s exactly what people said to sue . 
there are more of it than you really want to think . 
i think that &apos;s a fundamental interesting question . 
that &apos;s the first invention i wanted to describe . 
well , you go to the real atmosphere of this planet . 
it &apos;s going to stop because we have the resources . 
right . because i don &apos;t even touch it . 
e : quak , quak , quak . 
i &apos;m going to show you what you can do right now . 
and that &apos;s mostly because there is no one . 
you think a punishment is bad . 
well , the thing has advantages and disadvantages . 
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with . 
purple and pure form , by the way . 
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental . 
well , i &apos;m going to jump a bit forward . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to show you right now . 
it &apos;s very important for us to survive . 
and just down the street , you see jet . 
well , i thought , that &apos;s not good enough . 
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems . 
i knew what woman i wanted to take . 
the older you get , the more you get . 
they &apos;re a good person . they complain . 
we &apos;re also waiting for slower ones . ok . 
there &apos;s no patents . everybody can do it . 
well , there was progress in this area recently . 
if he quoted , he never failed . 
i realize that this is ambiguous . 
i &apos;m here today to challenge people . 
the sticks , the carrots . 
but we &apos;ve seen what that leads to . 
it was absolutely clear . i didn &apos;t have to think about it . 
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming back . a new wave . 
i &apos;m done in fact . science will never disappear . 
i believe that there is such a solution . 
this is one of my favorite examples , belmar . 
and it was deep . deep in my soul . 
in your and mine and in our children . 
this is terrible , all of the oil in the water . 
three years , and today we can &apos;t do that anymore . 
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem . 
there are other ways of suppressing the system . 
or sneemobile . you don &apos;t need snow . 
you get a sense of where things come from . 
it &apos;s my passion to teach glc everywhere . 
they immediately knew why they woke up in the morning . 
and the answer is , not yet , they work . 
yes , frisur -- i stand on that . 
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is . 
as you can see , the tumor blocks its eyes . 
i just thought money was going to do it . 
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is . 
you can see that these two have to coexist . 
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot; 
so what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution . 
these places are the most important we have to protect . 
very strange , i analyzed it some time . 
and if you can , you just draw a pattern . 
we &apos;re interested in big , helle displays . 
it really takes longer . it takes five days . 
so i have to adapt to something new . 
then , after a few weeks , we hire camp . 
but really , independence was good for japan . 
and if you can do that , incredible things happen . 
i was in iraq , in afghanistan and in liberia . 
but they don &apos;t incentivize to behave that way . 
these are some of the images that visitors sent me . 
message number three : don &apos;t go before you leave . 
we need an anti-templeton that comes out . 
they have to be alive , they have to be feeding . 
so this is the internet you have in your head . 
and there it was . his universe was on punch cards . 
the details that you can do today are amazing . 
energy is the most important thing , which is all changing factor here . 
it &apos;s really bad . my brothers get everything . &quot; 
and -- oh , i &apos;ve seen goldie hawn . 
it &apos;s often water that stops us . 
and he &apos;s enjoying what the sollist is doing . 
the other one , but he might see too many patterns . 
they found that they were worth two billion pounds . 
look at you first . look first . 
ok , squirt your way to stay there . 
it triggers them to distort reality . 
now , the three sons started to negotiate . 
this is my workplace . he &apos;s out there . 
they &apos;re not expensive , they &apos;re not quite irsensitive . 
and then we have silk , thai silk . 
the problem is that we can &apos;t afford it . 
why not ? i think that &apos;s pretty important . 
she said , &quot; change your profession . &quot; 
we know our societies have to radically change . 
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot; 
i often talk about thinking about situations . 
now , i know this seems ridiculous . 
now you think , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions . 
here &apos;s the footage i showed to the people . 
you know why ? because this music expresses pain . 
bl : all right . one , two , three . 
people in white hats , sailing boats . 
ears are not there to hear , but to listen . 
the more you play , the bigger your brain is . 
obviously an artist , she &apos;s a creative person . 
and win , even though the opponent has made more points . 
that was great because i had sold that way . 
now think of as an analogy of physical health . 
maybe people should save more if they make more money . 
and look , the first african countries are coming in . 
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids . 
once upon a time , the installation is very simple . 
wealth , loving kindness instead of hatred . 
they just want to do what they &apos;ve always done . 
imagine what it looks like . 
i want to tell you a few stories that explain my view . 
there &apos;s 100,000 there . that would take a day long . 
you know , the system doesn &apos;t automatically happen . 
these cold , hard winter , i love it . 
but he doesn &apos;t make a miracle to just give . 
the short answer is , in fact , they &apos;re from japan . 
if the answer is yes , you have a good job . 
when i do my work , people hate me . 
we have to act as we move away from the future . 
why not ? i mean , we &apos;re doing it this way . 
and i often look at things like they &apos;re eating . 
and the more it says it , the worse the impact . 
and when food is not obvious , they take sex . 
it &apos;s kind of nice . what a wonderful design . 
great . cool . it was really about the crowd . 
and it &apos;s not that my boys are laughing me . 
with both hands , faster . yes , good , good . 
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies . 
we want to eat them , not to be eaten by them . 
now , oh , oh , then further , further . 
ok , now , do you think of hesick at all ? 
here you can see it &apos;s going to be vibrating . 
and ... built the society that we live in now . 
and what if at all , do men have to do with it ? 
and we &apos;re hoping in them . thank you very much . 
well , thank you all for being here . 
what &apos;s necessary now is rebuilding these boundaries . 
when we &apos;re married , we have children rather . 
aid can &apos;t solve our problems , i &apos;m convinced . 
i wish we had the money and bigger resources . 
but we have hope again . we have a new man . 
it &apos;s very painful , although it doesn &apos;t mean anything . 
the idea was to evacuate the target cities . 
really , consciousness is in the front lobe . 
100 million dollars -- hey , i can fly to the moon . 
and that &apos;s true . but it &apos;s more than that . 
diving error , you can share a part of your exchange . 
don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work . 
these are the two concepts i want to explore . 
and it &apos;s actually not much better now . 
animals may like to play , but they don &apos;t like to see . 
ladies and gentlemen , this story hasn &apos;t yet been published . 
i don &apos;t know where julian morrow has that . 
beautiful , but again , it &apos;s a cheap trick , right ? 
that &apos;s it . and you would never know . 
there &apos;s , for example , the character of noora . 
it seemed as a means to bring both of us together , to work . 
and i came across the cards that you see here . 
no , because the wind should get the anger . 
milo : i wonder how deep it is . 
but remember , there is greece today . 
and they asked me if they can send me a sphere . 
all i have to do is follow into humility . 
ok , that &apos;s the slide of &quot; healing . &quot; 
you know , i was sitting at home and i looked at it . 
and so we &apos;re tended to pray ourselves . 
i &apos;ve designed the process that shape has generated . 
people wrote to me to get prints of it . 
but actually , i &apos;m here today to tell a story . 
now , to the cow model i was talking about . 
i designed it to help children with treatment . 
&quot; aha ! &quot; says the princess . 
so we don &apos;t notice anything that &apos;s true . 
but i wanted to show him something that will prepare him . 
gut feeling , that &apos;s what we use . &quot; 
we hope to build that up to the fall . 
but this is surprising again . you don &apos;t expect that . 
answer : &quot; dr. barnett , you &apos;re right . &quot; 
here &apos;s a female who &apos;s got it iron . 
twenty-one percent say , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot; 
all right , right . i &apos;m not a victim anymore . 
no one has tried it before , so i &apos;ll try it . 
you have to be able to do this kind of right , rosy . 
and that &apos;s how it &apos;s done . it &apos;s a divorce . 
if you &apos;ve done that , the rest of you are going to walk . 
if you don &apos;t know one of the languages , you learn immediately . 
you can lay out , but not the managers . 
for her , that was the kind of attention she needed . 
we thought a patient would like to understand the relationship . 
that , all these bad news , can be avoided . 
do you remember the story ? no , it &apos;s big . 
there was never one company that has no competition . 
i juble because it &apos;s still in my body . 
in order to make that a rule , you needed a concept immediately . 
these are the classical conditions that lead to regret . 
and i realized it was ok to go . 
we understand the software programs that control our bodies . 
it &apos;s certainly what i learned during my education . 
so , this device is an optical tarncap . 
something , again , that goes back to something more fundamental . 
if i lift the pile , i peek it . 
you &apos;ve heard about it . you know what that means . 
but making this in a traditional way is hard . 
there &apos;s already a movement that looks for better solutions . 
so the piece of art was to bring these two sides together . 
i was lying on a thin , hard special bed . 
let &apos;s zoom on the scale , let &apos;s see a human hair . 
but it &apos;s hard to hear the words sound loud . 
what they found was false labeled fish . 
i really think that &apos;s where it &apos;s going to have its roots . 
half of them deserved to look for gold . 
i couldn &apos;t wait to solve the fantastic mind . 
that means we get our new hip free . 
we have names for places where there are no people . 
whether you believe it or not , some of us survive that . 
so , we know that this was not a cheap war . 
&quot; what should i tell ? &quot; i said . 
and that somehow leads to intelligent behavior prediction . 
some of the studies have even shown that we &apos;re happier . 
and that &apos;s what leads to the first step here . 
you fly from the island , if you get a disease . 
so eight of us went in , four men and four women . 
and then it &apos;s time to treat them again . last year . 
and most people say , &quot; ok , i play . &quot; 
helium has to spread out , so the shape . 
and we have to think about how we can actually design this . 
i wanted a life that i could be proud of . 
and when she came to the house , she was greeted . 
and that seems to be all we &apos;re concerned about right now . 
and i said , &quot; yes , like the humane society . 
my son says he &apos;s not ready to marry . 
so i thought it would be good to start with it . 
it takes a moment , but it &apos;s excellent . 
i come up , and there &apos;s a vault . 
i didn &apos;t deserve it , i don &apos;t deserve anything . 
ladies and gentlemen , i want to be out of time . 
imagine driving into the holiday . 
for yourself , it doesn &apos;t have to mean to embrace violence . 
and frankly , i &apos;m on big prejudice . 
now , the counterpart of a snob is her mother . 
it keeps perpetual . it &apos;s a very strange medium . 
i &apos;ve collected pictures of how mothers do this . 
they were interested in health , they were interested in education . 
remember , we don &apos;t all have a picture . 
and yes , she was too old for fourth grade . 
i mean really hard , information seems to be our best hope . 
but we don &apos;t use them . the numbers are just around like this . 
that &apos;s the pure truth , the legal truth . 
and if you do that , i &apos;m standing in line . 
and when someone says that , you feel strange . 
we &apos;ve heard about the amish , the cars . 
we need to know why people do what they do . 
i became a team chapter , and that was great . 
you &apos;ve heard about dna , maybe in biology . 
i &apos;m an ecologist and i study complexity . i like complexity . 
some people are going to try and motivate others for their team . 
all of this can happen if we don &apos;t take the problem seriously . 
this is normal dna , what you think is normal dna . 
i do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible . 
frankly , better or worse ? say , &quot; yes . &quot; 
it &apos;s hard to appreciate , because there are different motives . 
and the answer , of course , is , &quot; they don &apos;t . &quot; 
ts : yeah , we &apos;re going to take some canvas . 
i know what you &apos;re thinking about when you look at these pictures . 
if you zoom in closer to that , look like this . 
they &apos;re not just going to change from now on up . 
they lived above the business they were working in . 
they &apos;re different at the market , and here &apos;s a couple . 
it &apos;s hard for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die . 
these are just a few examples that teach us traditional societies . 
in fact , i wanted to be a pop star . 
and the answer is , if you open enough of it -- yes . 
so , tms , you have to say a few words . 
when the mission was over , they landed on the thing . 
bf : 10 years of perfection you &apos;re going to see in the same way . 
we don &apos;t think cameras are good at apartments . 
and we &apos;ve found that we can measure this very precisely . 
what have i learned from this case ? well , three things . 
fireworks . the smell of a parrot , no . 
i see there &apos;s still a lot of work coming up to me . 
it makes sense , again , to think about an analogy with language . 
that leads to the last point , which is our elections . 
colin camerer : neuroscience , play theory . 
imagine if you were all participants in this study . 
i suspect that this is a lot of animals . 
it &apos;s an inherited , curved indoor facility . 
i was thinking about building my own little rockets . 
imagine generating all our hard materials like this . 
i was 27th , i thought i knew everything . 
we discovered that they work alone by intermolecular forces . 
so , this is about state budgets . 
accurity means good or bad , positive or negative . 
this is the region where entropy is low . 
but the gene that governs is damaged . 
but we feel the same thing could work in other places as well . 
it &apos;s really cold . it &apos;s 7,300 meters . 
it &apos;s this brain that triggers this reflex . 
it took a lot of hours a day to improve my ability . 
this is the planet that we &apos;ve played on so far . 
we &apos;ve talked about mobility , now we &apos;re talking about health . 
it turns out that different tasks are actually interdependent . 
and we &apos;re going to live in a peaceful world . thank you . 
and i think it &apos;s not a rubber at all . 
so i decided to study the economics of terror . 
so we have these fingertips , other ones have dinosaurs . 
i &apos;m working on breaking up this sense of elitism . 
now it goes down to a , to g and to f . 
a boy should have gone . we can &apos;t do that . &quot; 
it &apos;s more than a device ; it &apos;s renewable . 
i didn &apos;t want them to be threatening or dangerous . 
it doesn &apos;t have to look like this , this is actually what it looks like today . 
i don &apos;t know if i can explain it more clearly . 
i see a lot of kids . they go up and down the stairs . 
what i often do is do private partnerships . 
i &apos;m going to spend a lot of money on it . i have a better idea . 
they &apos;re adjusting me so i &apos;m not making a pinch . 
but when i thought about something else , it was a very simple thing . 
and that &apos;s more clear than it &apos;s been for decades . 
and that , in my view , is an idea that deserves prevalence . 
these are things that are different for every patient . 
it certainly didn &apos;t prepare me for what was next . 
but it &apos;s also clear that prosperity means more than that . 
so we can study it as a physical , intuitive model . 
we don &apos;t really have the right words to describe them until now . 
right ? one patient holding the tax , for example . 
and if we toss the ballast overboard , we &apos;ll go up . 
as he did that , he noticed an unexpected thing . 
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re confined at the moment . 
oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have its own signature . 
we suspect that corn has its origin in in mexico . 
you see , it &apos;s not as dramatic as the tsunami . 
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites . 
and more importantly , they &apos;re dressed well . 
we explained to them that we &apos;re going to send number three to them . 
and to keep going one step further , we have a heart here . 
so they often take the first best to offer them . 
so i think we have a completely wrong eating behavior . 
i want to encourage you to expand your horizon . 
and that means we need to increase efficiency even more . 
i suppose you can only have a miracle per building . 
that &apos;s not the only place we &apos;ve had interventions . 
this is a film that we &apos;ve heard a lot about . 
this understanding of chemistry can help us , in our everyday lives . 
i wrote the book because i wanted to find out something about life . 
in fact , it was also the answer of aristotle . 
look at what happens when the foot hits your sandwich . 
they have special interest in technology that will help our soldiers . 
and i think he was right there , almost a decade ago . 
so , this inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity . 
you know , an audience like you , yes , is the show . 
these are the basic traits of my device , or our device . 
they want to order , also to cost those who are at the bottom . 
the future is , as we know , very unpredictable . 
okay , i &apos;ve been cheating , that &apos;s just 20 seconds . 
there is no light sources except the ones we bring . 
if they &apos;re bad , you &apos;ve caused them . learn from that . 
instead of investing in a car , we invest in the community . 
they &apos;re beautiful designed to just use and user-friendly . 
i go back and forth , i &apos;m not getting anywhere . 
so we start paying money that we really have . 
and we decided to use recipes to that purpose . 
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , everybody knows that . 
ben saunders : yes , hi , ben saunders . 
no way to prove that they &apos;re here at all . 
it didn &apos;t matter if i wasn &apos;t going to create the peace day . 
i see this word , i hear this word , i feel this word everywhere . 
because it &apos;s going to lead me to the internet , where i can reach everyone . 
yes , yes , back to the corner . back to the corner . 
&quot; what is love ? &quot; wrote shakespeare . 
722 is 500 -- oh , that &apos;s a harder one . 
i think many of you are probably in the other way . 
this was one of the biggest factories i &apos;ve ever seen . 
please remember that these people are otherwise completely normal . 
of course , it &apos;s mostly because climate change has such good images . 
bf : that &apos;s ok , that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing . all right . 
a couple of them . this is attila the henne . 
if you have the second side here , most of them left you . 
what would it be ? i think infrastructure could solve the problem . 
they had to measure the milk and then mix the milk . 
we first got citizens , not the officers . 
here &apos;s another interesting example in seoul , korea . 
not the painter , i don &apos;t want to think about the painter . 
in fact , it &apos;s basically the same way in the 14th century . 
some are already partly available , in the upper half . 
because there &apos;s nothing in here . well , it &apos;s not supposed to be here . 
so in 1997 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s bring the women together . 
armeen use it when you &apos;ve lost a battle . 
bl : that &apos;s the term of technology . all right . 
wrong . i don &apos;t look at them . i can &apos;t see them . 
and now we see that the change in japan was huge . 
and some people think that we &apos;re born in a different way . 
so , aicha , do you have some final words ? 
its strength is based on the ability to make other people strong . 
masters sounds so silly , but it was also that . 
if you &apos;re in that framework , you &apos;re going to take some theorist . 
but they did well by adapting it to india . 
we have pretty bad secular , i would say . 
after he died , i realized no one writes me more . 
so , &quot; i saw a lot of trains , and i did it with a danger . 
a couple of friends and i have figured out how to do it . 
i &apos;m also laughing up the bad pictures because they are . 
and this all came from this , shrimp farms . 
where is art ? there is productivity , there &apos;s sports . 
that means that our bacteria actually lived from the phthalates . 
so he was convinced , but in fact , most people aren &apos;t . 
there is no doubt in my understanding that this is going to happen . 
in fact , you can see that each logo is a little different . 
nigerian filmmakers are really doing what they like . 
it &apos;s our belief , and we &apos;ll stay true to it . &quot; 
we can increase the volume if this is possible . 
but , oh , the murderers are in the camps . 
players are being asked to be very creative in this game . 
the threat is serious , and we need to be prepared now . 
the other partners that we have are economies and communities . 
undisappeared , unconspiracy , unwiped . 
i think these are the basic stones for peace in the future . 
but it took 24 years to succeed in action . 
but they can show you how to build things in a sequence . 
so , i managed to stumble a adulterer . 
this is a picture taken on the summit ridge . 
make it go away . make it go away . &quot; 
the bad news is it &apos;s rocket fuel . 
i set up a studio and tried to publish my work . 
the second reason is , i think , political correctness . 
and we approach them together , like medieval monks . 
so , what do i discover when i look at works of art ? 
the irony of the matter is that you don &apos;t have to be . 
and even more shocking , they &apos;re from what he &apos;s saying . 
they don &apos;t experience the fixation the way we would . &quot; 
this is something that you can be very , very optimistic about . 
there are three obvious ways that you can do this . 
anyway , i &apos;m going to ask you to communicate these values with me . 
let &apos;s take the ones that say they &apos;re saving too little . 
i go all over and i pretend it &apos;s iran . 
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about these young people without arms . 
i think there &apos;s a story there that needs to be told . 
there &apos;s a jewish adage i love . 
when you pump up a bicycle , you use some of it . 
there are all these different ways , but they &apos;re different effective . 
hi . this guy here believes he can predict the future . 
door , door , color , you know what i mean . 
and that made him crazy . really . he had clues . 
and the joke is , of course , that it &apos;s not just in the market . 
he &apos;s going to say , &quot; because he &apos;s there . &quot; 
and then in 24 months , people can turn out to space . 
he &apos;s really hurting . we &apos;re just amplifying it , right ? 
and then they test this new hypothesis , and so on and so forth . 
but i want to tell you a story to illustrate that . 
well , the reason is , there &apos;s not enough donor circles . 
and all they can carry on is great . 
it didn &apos;t happen because an incredibly smart person had to say that . 
it &apos;s so beautiful to say &quot; a , &quot; i guess . 
but there are a number of other people that you don &apos;t know . 
so , the house is no longer designed for the invasion . 
the dutch are also good , but italians are good . 
and that was a good thing to be supported . 
at the beginning of the year 1960 , you see that inspiration remains stable . 
i think i &apos;ve never been so happy all of my life . 
&quot; no , my daughter , she comes with the buick . 
it was designed for extension of human intelligence , so it was called that . 
here &apos;s a design that distinguishes water with the sun . 
so let &apos;s try and ask a question about health care . 
they are what we have in our field every year around the world every year . 
so there are a lot of examples like this that we &apos;ve been talking about . 
and we even know something about the way our brain does that . 
they complained prices , and i don &apos;t know . 
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat . 
it basically means to be human , and to do the right thing . 
it &apos;s all so clear , but they &apos;re denying it . &quot; 
look , the world has changed from analog to digital . 
and as soon as that happens , a moment that will kick the robot . 
and once the thing started , there was no more return . 
it &apos;s a human dream to fly like a bird . 
they &apos;re fused together , so you can &apos;t separate them . 
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can . 
every year , it &apos;s 7,000 -- people who get the first time . 
i can see my work as a job , i can do it for money . 
it &apos;s a logical plan , but it &apos;s not always been that way . 
yeah , i was thinking . we all know that , right ? 
so this is the hanging in which we &apos;re trying to see patterns . 
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of the sheep . 
she didn &apos;t want to eat . she didn &apos;t want to sleep . she didn &apos;t want to sleep . 
i don &apos;t think only we can really solve this problem by ourselves . 
we study for three reasons , the weakest one , the curiosity . 
it &apos;s been on the planet since the beginning of the animals , 500 million years . 
it &apos;s not the first time we &apos;re experiencing a technical revolution . 
and for the first time in three generations , his children would go to school . 
keep it , keep it , both of you , hold it . 
the problem is that there are very complicated forces in the climate system . 
i &apos;m very afraid . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it . 
but we have a problem of perception , a lot of people just don &apos;t understand it . 
if you move the mouse around the computer , the arrow moves . 
it &apos;s always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating . 
i love to hear about all this species on the bottom of the ocean . 
this is a basic feature we use with our technology . 
ok , oil policy is very morally present in the united states . 
so here i actually have -- i know exactly where the cards are . 
mr. teszler hired 16 men , eight white , eight black men . 
really , basically , we do this . the fact is , not very much . 
the girl , to my territory , turned the view . 
when i do something that hurt you , i feel the pain . 
i turn the push and try to go down slowly . 
this is what your office should look like , this is part of my love . 
i wrote this post , and i took that from einstein today . 
when i make some money , i &apos;m going to leave one for myself . 
and it doesn &apos;t fit to the future that we &apos;re moving towards . 
the investments flow in telecommunications , shopping centers . 
the first one is , again , remember , this is four year-olds . 
i delivered women of 70-year-old women who were playing bridge . 
and that &apos;s the back door that your computer is being taken over . 
i think that you can teach crows to do other things . 
when it comes to our stories , we love to be wrong . 
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons . 
teacher : now it &apos;s shifting in both directions . look what happens . 
so , it &apos;s about a mile in diameter , 200 meters deep . 
if we can do that , you &apos;ll forget the molecular details . 
on the internet , we have the videos full of length if you &apos;re interested . 
in fact , we believe that the future is happening . 
i repeat ; the unexpected , which is also the brute . 
move your eyes , blink your eyes , maybe close your eye . 
that &apos;s the view right across the street where they were . 
and someone else has one thing , which is the complete opposite of it . 
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not true : feel and feel something . 
that &apos;s what business is doing , by getting profits . 
they don &apos;t seem kind of sexy and elegant , which is hidden . 
by the way , these are my kids , which are , of course , wonderful and so on . 
all the books are sold in the store . near the plank . 
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re just going to play for a moment . 
so if somebody wants to copy us , come and do it , go ahead . 
and he asked this particular person what crows and fish have in common . 
and it &apos;s become more , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet . 
the robot is obviously able to execute every railway curve . 
nobody should know i was a girl , and no one knew it . 
now you might say it doesn &apos;t really look like it in the beginning . 
moment -- it &apos;s in that condition , we still have a lot to do . 
among other things , we know that they &apos;re mostly really hard to overcome . 
but it &apos;s the common action of us that makes change . 
and you &apos;re paid for it . you can think about it if you want to . 
but the real projections for those , i would give in something like this . 
not because we &apos;re still going to wind and need to build . 
we really expected stars to stand in this environment . 
politicians in a big , complex , tricky it-project ? 
she was smiling . she couldn &apos;t understand why i was so worried . 
i don &apos;t have to worry in my age where the bridge is going . 
we didn &apos;t think there would be so many maps around the world . 
it &apos;s going to let us question what it means to be a human . 
the middle income countries , the emerging economies , they pick up . 
there is no dog around the world , the natural origin . 
this is the skyline of doha , which i think most of you are familiar with . 
and most of all , she &apos;s able to resolve this peaceful . 
no ceo , no responsible single company , to create it . 
and then , like karajan . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ? 
and i know you &apos;re all thinking about dodgeball teams now . 
or you can go back and change altitude . now , skill . 
these are the conditions of the tubes that leave the animal like this . 
so the possibility is just to wrap the tube from the outside . 
an example , a great example , is the danger of space . 
and all of a sudden , without even realizing it , you see the world differently . 
she said she was &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot; 
the architectural translation was , quite frankly , simple . 
just throw overboard , like ballast , to change our direction . 
obviously , the product we want to be harmless for people . 
the environments that we live in are normally looking like this . 
it was the time that all the great species came up . 
and then they say , oh yes , constant acceleration . 
they didn &apos;t kill them , they called us to catch them . 
whatever the future is , we should fight the &#91; cat &#93; . 
it can &apos;t afford to question that nursing person . 
we should probably slow down , and we should probably do that right now . 
you know , of course , and i know that coca cola is the better choice . 
we look at the inner life of the person , the bad eggs . 
to succeed , i became pretty good at finding new ideas . 
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . 
it &apos;s not about the fact that she &apos;s guaranteing peace inside and the outside . 
the rules i &apos;m talking about are constantly overwhelmed by our culture . 
as we fly past , we looked back . and guess what we saw . 
and i think it all fits up much better if you do it that way . 
our first year , the first net in october of 2003 went from the band . 
and this cell is one of the thousands of different types of cells that we &apos;re learning about . 
so let me show you this , i &apos;m going to start with the standard method . 
and the danger is that you can create a pandemic . 
and in total , we all had no idea if we could do it . 
when other people see my tattoo , they usually like what it looks like . 
i have to say , at that time , i couldn &apos;t even find the bird , really . 
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change . 
everybody &apos;s a sun with a group of planets around them . 
no , i was quiet , because i didn &apos;t get to the truth . 
and if it &apos;s a good story , it may even make us smile . 
let &apos;s go back a couple of years and see what was going on back then . 
okay , you see ? that &apos;s it . it &apos;s almost done . there &apos;s wires . 
and finally , there are the radio waves that i &apos;ve already mentioned before . 
and this is where we &apos;re headed , the first steps , we &apos;re going to put a wall on . 
and in two hours after their backs were broken , they were changed . 
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to people in the field . 
and then i &apos;m going to show you that it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated . 
so , that &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it there . 
many of us here have made this decision , and it &apos;s not really hard . 
the first spike , obviously , is the leg that hits the load cell . 
so david , in history , is supposed to be the underlies , right ? 
so the law can be the basis of freedom , people have to trust him . 
most of the educational games that we have are actually reading maps . 
with a thousand julians working together , mexico would be a very different country . 
this is our last number , and nat is going to play on the piano . 
there are important consequences of distribution , but there are others that you would expect . 
now , not all of these attempts to do great for love work well . 
they &apos;ve been building it for so long that i don &apos;t know where it is . 
animation , software , filmmaking programs , they have all this . 
so what i want to tell you about this is that we know child mortality . 
the region that looks like a horn is what we call sweet spot . 
everyone , up to chance . she didn &apos;t believe in the accident . 
i remember when i was doing that , and it was open to holding up . 
the key is never the resources , it &apos;s &quot; resource evoll . &quot; 
i think we all have a vision for the health care system in this country . 
&quot; hah , i &apos;m the only one i &apos;ve ever loved . &quot; 
we stopped irrigating our soil as far as we did . 
it &apos;s our father pond . well , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . &quot; 
and the man who gave this talk that night was very interesting . 
maybe these people are right . they may not be very good to think about it . 
don &apos;t stand rubbing , don &apos;t pants at high height , none of it . 
if you &apos;re wired to do business , you do business . 
and i swam through the night , and also through the next day . 
because it meant that at least one person had understood me . thank you . 
and this is the first theater project i &apos;ve been working on . 
and in particular , i think we can learn something about this . 
thank you very much . as : thank you . thank you chris . 
in fact , he was 15 inches taller than i was , and she was so big . 
and in my view , what does it mean to be disabled ? 
well , that &apos;s not quite true . you can do it through sweats . 
so we &apos;re realizing that crows are really , really smart . 
people , this is not a simple metaphor that i &apos;m talking about , it &apos;s true . 
everything started with seeds in a classroom , with me , looking like this . 
instead of sending a product to the world , we send data on the internet . 
in the big and small , the story of victims is how we see women . 
and this is the dead head , the dead head . 
we work together , whether side side or over-distance , is always important . 
cooking , cleaning , shopping , building . but they &apos;re not here . 
so this is the scenario that we should put on capital . 
and the second thing is , i &apos;m not interested in the word , i &apos;m interested in how you use it . 
but that tells us how we need to look at it , and where we need to go . 
it &apos;s all about us , because we &apos;re women , because we love our children . 
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior . 
and , as many bottles do you tell me i have a problem ? 
is it a story of the year , a story of the decade , or more ? 
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , we share and discuss ideas . 
this is a report that you can look online ; the video is online . 
i feel that i would have lost for so many years . &quot; 
the problem is that there &apos;s nothing in cancer that &apos;s in them . 
you meet some great people , people who see the world with very different eyes . 
all right . i go to the pharmacy , i &apos;m sick and i need drugs . 
if you want to change the world , you have to form groups , collaborate . 
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s much easier than a school learned mathematics . 
it &apos;s so obvious , it &apos;s so obvious , and somebody had to have this idea . 
so they expect the future to be worse than it is . 
for the fourth time here , i think i &apos;m here for this wisdom . 
you find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs and so on . 
my father , who i &apos;ve talked about , died of aids in 1999 . 
now this is forbidden , and the sharks are certainly excited about this . 
and they &apos;re also able to walk upright over long distances . 
but maybe it helps if i put a hole in the head . &quot; 
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s penguin shit . &quot; 
what our sender does is it &apos;s what dirty jobs are . 
so the funders have to engage in the long term , at least for 10 years . 
you can think of it as a language of thoughts , or &quot; mentalese . &quot; 
your picture of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what shapes us . 
these systems that we unprepared could have been present before . 
the thing that killed us was not the muslims , were not the arabs . 
i mean , how high is the likelihood that all 10 are willing to stop ? 
we humans are social , we &apos;re empathy , and that &apos;s great . 
and now comes the coast , and a very small part of me is sad . 
so it &apos;s not that my topic is the most important thing . it &apos;s not . 
what i mean is , you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk . 
well , she &apos;s got c , g , h , a , she &apos;s chosen e . 
it &apos;s also what i &apos;m looking for in my work , looking for a personal sense . 
you can &apos;t ask him how old it is , because it &apos;s armed . 
number three : the handouts you &apos;re not giving is your presentation . 
well , i was so stupid , but not so stupid to reject that . 
we use everything we have an impact to get it to the table . 
well , i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old . 
and that would be the test for lip balancing that we have over here . 
the reason we worry about it is complexity that science has given us . 
this is dunhan , one of the biggest cities that has been defeated . 
all the time i &apos;m in lake , i don &apos;t usually see anybody . 
but i think we should also look at the numbers of what reality really looks like . 
it &apos;s a story that is evidence for the teacher and the teacher . 
remember that this is an example of architecture actually achieved something . 
i got mad . brothers can argue . parents and children can argue . 
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re the beaks that hold up the troops . 
she &apos;s ready to handle those with bed nets , with other things . 
it says a lot about their fellow students that they chose . 
she was like one of these women , d behind the sewing machines , pretty similar . 
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i &apos;ve just heard . 
one package that changes color when your milk has gotten bad . 
but everything doesn &apos;t matter if we &apos;re not able to protect the oceans . 
that &apos;s all there is to say . apple patented this . 
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my place ? 
the real social innovation i want to talk about is charity . 
it &apos;s made up of two pieces that we call encoder and transducer . 
do it for fun . no one gets a cent , a euroo or yen . 
and if we say , &quot; yes , we need more . it has to go on . &quot; 
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about what scientists should do . 
it has a little bit to do with the last , but it &apos;s much more erotic . 
it &apos;s solvable , not as a democrat , not as a republican . 
who &apos;s going to stop and say , oh , look , a cow ? nobody . 
the first thing he saw was a floating handle . 
i was asked to design a building , because the expo was environmental issues . 
but she went to jupiter , saturn , uranus and nepdo . 
i &apos;ve been to google last month , and wow , what a cafeteria ! 
but now we need a new fire that makes us secure , healthy and persistent . 
you can see that the scaters are practicing more often here . the obstacles are easier . 
yes , that means i didn &apos;t have to draw gyeonghoeru . 
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s nonsense , steve . a stupid idea . 
as i said , they &apos;re mostly on seals that are very , very small . 
so they don &apos;t have the tools , or the incentives , to the other customers . 
and a hammer , if we reach a hammer , is what we take . 
rm : yeah , that &apos;s the first time we ever learned about it . 
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why context is everything . 
i don &apos;t want them to be raised in school by other students . &quot; 
one of them , in anthropology , is exploring human universals . 
it does change , and what turns around is not software . 
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair went down . 
a long , long time ago , the world was once a big , heavy family . 
&quot; look . i had a dream too , but &quot; but &quot; but . &quot; 
engineer : absolutely interviewer . you thought , &quot; oh , crap . &quot; 
now , as an anthropologist , we know that every culture has its origin history . 
but we don &apos;t know where , because we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern . 
that was bad ! man , i was -- i was hat . i was sick . 
he wanted to try and visualize it using some basic principles . 
not the drugs themselves , but the treatment and care that &apos;s connected to it . 
and i was sure that it would be great for democracy and for our society . 
the feeling that no one &apos;s listening to me is very important in our relationship with technology . 
we were in the desert , in wadi rum , in a little jeep . 
from the fact that they only serve an audience , mainly western culture . 
as it copies , one of the billions of projects , it fails down . 
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to occupy the light socket . 
the laws of physics : invisible , forever , ubiquitous , ubiquitous . 
this is the work of quentin lindsey , who &apos;s a ph.d. . 
and in some ways , the music that it just works perfectly for these places . 
i &apos;m going to tell you some amazing things that happened when we started . 
work with it , come to the safe place , and let &apos;s move something . 
today , in sweden and other rich industries , people are using so many different machines . 
and this went on and on and on until i decided to do it full-time . 
the fact that there are exceptions here , it doesn &apos;t touch at the least . 
leibniz was the first person to actually talk about building a machine like this . 
the miracle of your mind is not that you can see the world as it is . 
the people who are interested in this class tend to have hacker mentality . 
suzanne , very briefly , what you have , aren &apos;t you randomly dreaming ? 
so when i was thinking about this , i suddenly realized that biology provided us the answer . 
we learn how to communicate with them in very high-frequents . 
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . really bad . don &apos;t look at me . 
it &apos;s the wrong way to teach kids that they can &apos;t make mistakes . 
every vacation i had as a young boy , i spent in national parks . 
i hope you respect my soldiers , this soldier with this water department . 
tell a child that she &apos;s sorry to do something , and it &apos;s going to be shocked . 
that is , you know , you have no power whatsoever to change anything . 
so , that &apos;s 20 microns on average , that pollen grain there . 
i mean , what if you had a nasal surgery , and you like the outcome ? 
i don &apos;t mean that we were born to join huge organized religions . 
and is it art to imagine what is beyond the horizon ? 
and he said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m teaching in a art department . 
i don &apos;t think i could take your cell phone away , even if i wanted to . 
and yes , they also interact with normal gestures , both hands , etc . 
i think it exists , and we have to look for it , and it &apos;s below the surface . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , which is -- a personal expression , a note . 
and of course , when that happens , the conditions improve , and they drive roller . 
think about how the word &quot; yo &quot; is used when teenagers are speaking today . 
that meant that my dream of becoming a teacher would not be fulfilled . 
i think most people in the industry understand that we have to embrace this problem . 
it &apos;s only when it goes wrong , we start to see the importance of families for children . 
this is something that we have known for a while , so we don &apos;t have any more breakthrough . 
but since i didn &apos;t have a family that asked me , they could do everything with me . 
you all know how that is ; you don &apos;t need a disability to understand that . 
now the answer may seem to be that the universe can create complexity , but with a big deal of difficulty . 
in order to realize that , we needed a design of research , like a magic trick . 
dl : like that , we &apos;re losing time , i &apos;m going to get to it . 
now , since you &apos;re done with it , you conclude it , because each cell phone has one in common . 
you know , what you win on one hand , you lose on the other . 
and everybody , of course , understood it . everybody said , &quot; yes , of course , they &apos;re completely right . 
and a social movement consists , in my eyes , is made of four main characteristics . 
it was at that moment when we realized that it was actually going to work . 
it &apos;s not just something that supports trees , it &apos;s something that connects people and countries . 
the future of these communities is in their people and in our ability to work with these people . 
so he wants to get money from my mother when she comes out , but she doesn &apos;t have enough . 
boone , i &apos;m really excited that they were here to this conversation . 
normal . let &apos;s go to the schools , something that i actually am a specialist . 
but basically it was hard . it was really difficult to explain how the web was going to be . 
from 100 indicates leaving , 60 will be prone again . 
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot; 
so i can say , in some sense , that , &quot; i think , so i am . &quot; 
we can tell our kids , ok , finish , that was our story . that &apos;s over . 
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to offer it to $ 100 , 200 dollars . 
one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you . &quot; 
i &apos;m here to suggest something better to you , which is that less maybe is more . 
and you know , we have a society , a world that is strong of fear . 
the only two conditions were that they studied at university , and they speak english . 
mobbing is a disease . prejudice is a disease . violence is a disease . 
now , if you want to represent this zero and one of the binary , you need a device . 
tell us what we do wrong . let &apos;s talk about where religion fails . &quot; 
but the problem is , you get hungry , that &apos;s just hard to ignore . 
i ask you , in the name of these children , whose faces you see -- that there is no longer . 
and i mean , &quot; look at them ! don &apos;t mind , don &apos;t you understand . 
el ninino comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s a rhythm . 
time . this is where i have two minutes , so we can &apos;t do this . 
this picture is actually quite interesting , because we made it , i think , three years ago . 
in fact , to make them stereotype , let &apos;s say they &apos;re both white men . 
for me , this was the space , which was what robots couldn &apos;t do yet . 
now , because time is limited here , i just want to focus on three strategies . 
blue cheese , ranch , essig and oil , thousand island and house . 
i was also very lucky that my mother did something that most women don &apos;t . 
we think the revenues are high , but the returns will be even bigger . 
how people get to this music , how it comes in their lives , that fascinates me . 
the animal could be a cow , a lamb , or something more exotic . 
and what has changed is something you don &apos;t expect in art , which is mathematics . 
so , anyway , thank you very much for letting me talk here . 
but the truth is that these crazy cases are relatively rare , mostly they won &apos;t . 
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended . 
that &apos;s the time between , the time when the direction of the month changes . 
one is that people need insurance , they &apos;re not going to be thrown out . 
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it the way we do it today . 
all right . little fire on ice . tell them not to kill me . 
look at this young bean that moves to capture the light always . 
i think that &apos;s the first step in that direction . that &apos;s the slow game . 
you can add proteins to them that light up when you light them up . 
if you &apos;re in the desert , they can communicate with each other up to about two kilometers wide . 
and what &apos;s even more disturbing is what happens with younger crises . 
and if we do what we &apos;ve discovered , the circuit changes . 
usually it &apos;s 90 percent . so , you tell me , you &apos;re sleeping better than expected . 
companies are not winning , not primarily in the original sense of creating social problems . 
skill number one is the ability to identify success and the skill to recognize failure . 
so again , what we &apos;re focusing on is prevention more like treatment , first of all . 
neighboring states . yemen , civil war . united arab emirate , money , that . 
so i found it very amazing to bump into an organization that values both sides . 
it allows us to create art , biotechnology , software and all kinds of wonderful things . 
&quot; we don &apos;t have a competition . there &apos;s no one ever made a device like this . &quot; 
and once a poison is in the food chain , it &apos;s all affected by it , it &apos;s also us . 
now , that &apos;s not necessarily what you think about before you buy a condom . 
i mean , i see patients die every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside them . 
we &apos;ll see that these kids also have a real opportunity to overcome their poverty . 
you can go right on the side now . it &apos;s all free . we &apos;re not trying to sell anything . 
that &apos;s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic . 
well , since i don &apos;t see a show of hands , it seems to be true what i &apos;m saying . 
so , dan , the very first thing you want to say to everybody here , and tell who you are ? 
because , as i said , we live in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of structure . 
but we thought , ok , if we had to do it already , then in the library . 
and , by the way , i call it the eleanor roosevelt of the right . 
the idea is that simple , so obvious , but the implications are really going to be far-ranging . 
you have to say , well , for the darkness of the skin , you don &apos;t just have to suffer . 
they &apos;re too frightened . they &apos;re too freezing . no . stop . 
i know there was a big hype to control our ability to control biology . 
and i want you to get the negative energy out of it by shaking it . 
what you see when you look at the title called &quot; pm car . &quot; 
we need an exercise . framework conditions to learn how to get more remarkable . 
and so he &apos;s standing there , he &apos;s holding up the bed , because the bed just doesn &apos;t work . 
so if you look at this little script there , the speed is always 30 . 
to shrink the story , i decided that i had to go back and do it . 
and when you see it squonally , you get content and shape -- and then beauty and truth . 
the question is , how do you find something new that has been around 5,000 years ? 
how do we do that ? so , we use a model system that we call the protocell . 
it &apos;s a client , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person involved . 
and since i have a 15-year-old at home , i have to cook all the time , cook , cook . 
if you look out the window , you can see long &apos;s peak , which you probably know . 
the group that i want to look at , though , is the people below , the footpeople . 
and where it doesn &apos;t do it , like in the greenest winter , mars is not far . 
uncle is drinking , doesn &apos;t use a condom . come back , start again . &quot; 
they asked me what i wanted to be , and then they told me what to not be . 
no buttons or trains that you have to make , just me and the game . 
and i mean seriously , i just think we should make it clear and move on . 
i mean , her hometown is literally whitesville , west virginia . 
i &apos;m going to show the per capita income on this axis , arm down there , rich up here . 
when the first computer came to the market , they were told that they were a million times faster than neurons . 
but for every disaster we had , the marathon found a way to bring people together . 
that &apos;s the bad news , but it may be surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news . 
and there are , i think , three ways in which these massive passive data can be used . 
and i was so excited , the first one i saw outside ebbets field . 
but no , for the protest , they all dressed in white , without makeup . 
some of the teenagers said the car was actually five meters away when the foot fell . 
it &apos;s not that i think spoken word poetry is the ideal form of art . 
i &apos;m going to ask my friends from america to send sisters and doctors to help us . 
i mean , now singapore is a world nation , ghana , not . 
some are driven by compassion , think that it may be one of the basic acts of humanity . 
and there are people who are using this computer to practice their officials . 
if you sprinkle like this , imagine what you &apos;re about to brush . 
i had learned to read notes now , and i was learning it slowly . 
i have a solution that doesn &apos;t require any mascals , firewood , another gas . 
he said , &quot; no , shame , i &apos;m not going anywhere . 
we show portal because you shoot on walls to create new spaces . 
and i &apos;ve met julius in the last week that i &apos;ve lived in kibera . 
invest the time and the energy that you have to spend in love with you ? 
this concept of peers , inc . &quot; is a very difficult and complex area . 
the country that &apos;s up there on the top is a place where i haven &apos;t been . 
more crime . we looked at everything , aids infications , flu , etc . 
the evolution of the dinosaurs was slow down , always a step slower , no matter how they measure it . 
finally , some people say , well , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells . i &apos;m conscious . 
sustainable energy is the biggest problem we have to solve this century , regardless of environmental problems . 
they said they would hide us if we were not going to make a shooter sweater for them . 
we decided to redefine health care as a doctor or a nurse or a mentor . 
it &apos;s a very simple trick , but i always do it when i have a window square . 
and if you think it &apos;s not going to go , it &apos;s going to push you that long , until you keep going . 
the other thing is , you know , it would be better if you didn &apos;t have to take blood . 
and when that happens , it has to change our understanding of our past , our present and human culture . 
as i &apos;m leaving the water , solly reaches a deep channel , a channel between us . 
and this is still in work , but dermatologists -- so , i &apos;m a pets . 
liver cells , nerve cells , pancreas cells -- we can &apos;t grow even today . 
zk : i just want you all to know that this demo of target is being supported . 
i had a terrible decision to make , and , frankly , it was political dynamic . 
i used to be a bachfan . i played bach on the guitar , you know . 
and where we don &apos;t need it at all , and we want to stay dark , we can avoid it . 
thank you very much , it &apos;s interesting , because we had to put together with the companies . 
then , a few years later , we &apos;re going to green this part of the desert using permaculture . 
here we have madd chadd , lil &apos;c , kid david and j smooth . 
it feels when the cell is ready , when the chromosomes have taken their position . 
for me , like millions of other people in the world today , english is an educational language . 
and for us young people , they &apos;re trying to become individuals and find the differences among each other . 
if you &apos;re really used to that , we &apos;re going to carry on crows that are coming back . 
it &apos;s just incredible to see several gharial smiling out of the river . 
it would be immoral to let these young people leave a climate system out of control . 
you have to do these steps . if you do that -- it &apos;s easy to interest kids in science . 
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , very high cost . 
so we deserve to be part of the ideal exchange , like everyone else . 
in every car accident where at least one person dies , there &apos;s information about everyone . 
charles darwin , i and you have left the family tree of chimpanzees about five million years ago . 
workers are treated as well or poorly , as the workers were treated , who have built this chair . &quot; 
and the book made me think about this theory , because i have to explain what i mean by that . 
but as soon as they walked past it , it started to climb up the wall . 
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s only rituals that make sense to us . &quot; 
and in fact , the first treatment methods , for people as well as dogs , are already available . 
you know , when you do something you love , it feels like five minutes . 
we are , or should it be moral , to be the healer of the world . 
he says that every culture tends to commute between two perspectives and back . 
what he really wanted to say is that we have basically collected letters brands here . 
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; &quot; and &quot; what should we start as we are ? &quot; 
so it &apos;s meant to learn something , to learn an idea from an organism and then to apply it . 
i noticed that the line is around where the only square building in the village is . 
but if you &apos;re together to plant trees for the environment , that &apos;s all right -- creativity . 
then the next day , i held a collection and a few women would come . 
but you noticed that i liked because i only went until 1994 . 
because dna is like a blueprint , you know , the living thing tells you what to do . 
let &apos;s suppose you have , well , completely different sensory organs and so forth . 
one of the things that i needed to learn as a journalist was how i was going to deal with my anger . 
you could buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything , because it was silent . 
you decide . this is your bakery , your street , your country , not mine . &quot; 
so we started with breast cancer , because there &apos;s a lot of money for this , not government money . 
oh . one more thing i wanted to point to you about . look at stickybot . 
and there are two important messages , or two lessons that you can take away from that reality . 
you see , this insight has potential , you could see it as a real underground barrel . 
i thought he &apos;d made the video . so , here we see it backwards . 
and what &apos;s even more important is that the troops i led were more than 20 countries . 
it &apos;s not necessary to stay with me all day to move the wheelchair . &quot; 
and that gives me hope , because it means that people are not exclusively selfish . 
the hospice was for people who were dying , but terence was not that far . 
one thing you can do with a picture like this is just admire it . 
and you may have noticed what we don &apos;t need to know , because there is no past the calculation . 
the leaders have a position of power or authority , but they are inspiring us . 
but there were times , i wanted to remember both sides that were fiction . 
so she went back to korea , to the village of hyun-sook , but she was gone . 
if you don &apos;t want to be reward , you have to know what you &apos;re hungry for . 
unfortunately , it &apos;s not really a picture . can i please have my drawing block ? thank you , wonderful . 
it &apos;s a holocaust of another way of ignoring that doesn &apos;t help anybody . 
anyway , we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about architecture today , about creation and optimism . 
and the philistist , who was submitted , is her mighty warrior , is a giant . 
the first time nothing &apos;s going to happen , because the system has no idea that he &apos;s going to draw . 
i wanted to know where the kind of learning that we find in school today . 
and &quot; ha-ha , there &apos;s a picture , and here i am . and what &apos;s the whole thing ? &quot; 
while this is something that comes out of our mind , it also has deep roots in the cosmos . 
she has a cabinet , an education minister , a minister of energy , a minister of health . 
and i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to make these peaks cooler . 
well , i thought i had the answer to that question , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot; 
and it &apos;s very hard to be happy on a planet that is devastated by hunger and drought . 
the material , which is designed , first of all , is either in liquid form or as a powder . 
so -- -- well , if you think about it , we have the problem of the ham . 
there &apos;s no real word for the things that make us secure , but we don &apos;t feel secure . 
we quickly realized that beavers can be something that takes the rotluchs . 
so think about these three situations that i told you about : factory , migration , office . 
interestingly , when people get that , they don &apos;t check again , but now they &apos;re part of it . 
they &apos;re actually trying to figure out what people should do instead of driving in rush hour . 
and i think , if you look at the animal world , that &apos;s one of the most remarkable things . 
now , this is a little test . i encourage you to try it at a party . 
we find it great when students keep it , even if they don &apos;t put mathematical pathways in there . 
it &apos;s not when great new tools show up that they use the society to penetrate . 
70 percent of all the antibiotics that are consumed in the united states will be taken on the animal posture . 
it &apos;s one of the many characteristics that women have , that bring them to work . 
seriously , these changes that i witnessed in the space , i thought i &apos;d gone for 12 years . 
but the idea is , like in a newspaper , for example , let &apos;s show the responding display . 
it &apos;s terrible . it &apos;s proof of of our failure to ensure their survival in the wild . 
well , we &apos;re collecting data from satellites , from airplanes , from vehicles , from people . 
if you &apos;re talking to someone who &apos;s loud to you , you can &apos;t understand it , it &apos;s too loud . 
i have a friend who has a digital blog on pdrs , a recording device . 
i showed this picture here , because i &apos;m often asked whether or not in the project animals are going to happen . 
you can see here that the little negative trials that should be below the left are gone . 
and mark twain , who knew all about printing , was obsessed with this machine . 
it has these strong , heroic arms that can sneak up donuts in their own mouth . 
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth in africa is not invested in africa ? 
but i thought , no , no , no , experimental with hartzen and experiments with polymers . 
and i think the reason this would be so interesting to you is that consciousness is so interesting . 
they can tweet their weight to their friends , and they can help them maintain their weight . 
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil who invested in the project , and also with the government . 
and he had a very big head , which he thought could point out in a water head . 
i started a few companies that i thought they would be the ticket to financial freedom . 
hopefully , we can now show the audience how it can be that you do what you do . 
and as a result , it &apos;s a completely different use of technology and knowledge that they &apos;re surrounded with . 
i just want to tell you that my job is a privilege , because we live in a special time . 
my student pranav , who , as i said , is the brilliant head behind this idea . 
i had those who could , but they didn &apos;t do , and which ones that did , but couldn &apos;t . 
in fact , we already have a surprising dancer , who &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m going to show you today . 
when i look around , in this tedxamsterdam auditorium , i see a special audience . 
it &apos;s very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this wonderful , climated room . 
we have to make sure that they are proud of being farmers , because they allow us to survive . 
when we start thinking exponentially , we can understand how this affects the technologies in our environment . 
and as you can see here , there are groups that grow over each other , because they spread out . 
for them , nations , countries , borders still have a big role , often a violent one . 
sb : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years . 
about half of them who are women , maybe one day , have done a pregnant test . 
bl : this bacterium that we &apos;ve talked about is the simplest one of us known life form . 
it &apos;s going to change perceptions and views of people who pay for it all , and that &apos;s our hope . 
and finally , the only portrait of a man he painted , &quot; the musician . &quot; 
of course , as soon as you say this , people say , impossible , and this is what suzuki said . 
it stays for months and years , and when that happens , it &apos;s a disease . 
i can see everything that romo sees , and i can see the view of a robot in the world . 
and in 1972 , the united states , began to set up a counterpart in the ocean , the national marine protected areas . 
it would have to be cheap , fast , easy , sensitive and specific and minimally invasive . 
you can look at these works of art and , of course , see the complex social organization of the people they &apos;ve created . 
and then you hear things like on the train , on the plane , in the car -- so on the way to work . 
in fact , a remediation of the technology and engineering of something that &apos;s so pure , practically pollutant . 
but what we &apos;re losing is , i think , exactly -- a sense of sense of the sky , a kind of context . 
some of the things that i &apos;ve made are the poster over here that you can play the stuff on . 
i &apos;ve learned that they are the essence of what progress is , even when they seem terrible . 
the first is that the largest political value for china is the true of the chinese civilization . 
this one , a little volatile , backwards , and it &apos;s looking at the back of the foot . 
of course , i can . and you &apos;re enjoying it unbelievable . i see you standing around -- right , everywhere . 
one was that dancing , which was , although it was not offered her , she meant everything . 
and i started to see the world from a whole new perspective , how pairs of people are connected to each other . 
&quot; look , when she said &quot; good morning , &quot; i recognized her accent of fife . 
you see , the indians also knew a river that separates the country of the living land of the dead . 
and we think that people probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and call barack obama . 
if you do that morning , i will die , you will die , every single one of these guys will die . 
tourist : people are very frustrated that they &apos;re not getting closer to seeing everything . 
and we &apos;re going to start affecting our health and our intelligence , the more we approach these technologies . 
i think ted , they affect the lives of people in ways that you might not even realize . 
there &apos;s only 102 , because at some point it &apos;s boring to collect it , and every year there &apos;s new . 
and after that , this year , the iron minister was discharged and convicted at 10 years of age . 
the second thing is to keep mothers healthy and alive , keep the children alive . no longer orphans . 
there are countless ways of connecting us to other people , and that seems to be the same everywhere . 
can you feel your anger , your fear , your anger about what &apos;s going on in your country ? 
as i said , we can cut the channel , we can spread it over the couch . 
we had proper nonsense , about 30 , 25 years ago , when this channel came . 
our interest is to find beauty that is more than just aesthetic , but actually a truth . 
they gave it to google , they translated it to italian , came back to the italian google . 
another interesting project that still needs some support is the broadwall rhinos . 
but let &apos;s bring some light into this amazing , multi-page continents that have so much to offer . 
you may not have a lot of data that you could put in there , but you know how to challenge it . 
they &apos;ve met children with a different standard and all that , a different way of thinking , a completely different society . 
we see people who feel &quot; abundant , &quot; &quot; consolated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot; 
they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them . 
bl : i &apos;m going to spit back to the moment of the decision , because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time . 
because one such mechanism has already been found , by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang . 
it &apos;s true that the internet and the new media are very useful to make things faster and cheaper . 
what &apos;s left is this separation , this increase in mortality , as you go up north . 
and even those who believed that make them better , languages exactly control . 
we went to africa , to sudan , to sierra leone , liberia , kenya . 
from the minute a child is taught to play an instrument , it &apos;s not an arm . 
and he said , &quot; i hope you &apos;ll have the strength to do what i did . 
i never had to care about the rent , could i spend my time doing what i really like . 
and after three minutes in this water , after only three minutes in this water , it was able to recover itself . 
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; great sister wong , &quot; washburn , wong , jacket like pants . 
that means before we could start digitizing the archimdes , we had to take the book apart . 
i remember thinking , &quot; that &apos;s exactly why we actually have to work harder . 
the doctors , the doctors , it seemed , had never really enough time for all their patients , so much they tried . 
so this is the pattern that each one of you accomplished , but you were all a little bit different . 
we &apos;re increasingly presented a diet in the sense , not the history , dominated . 
i have to admit , it wasn &apos;t what i presented to my first day down under . 
that &apos;s what i aspire every time i open my mouth -- this impossible connection . 
another strategy that we &apos;ve been following is using decellular organs . 
it &apos;s based on a couple of thousand people we &apos;ve taken samples on a handful of groups around the world . 
in short , they get the status that they had before a million years ago , 10,000 or 100,000 years ago . 
this is an example of how software is now building its own hardware , and so we &apos;re going to imagine biology . 
michael free of &quot; path &quot; says who &apos;s looking for a product like this and paid . 
what we need to do is to require our lives , our objects , our objects , our circumstances , our intent of purpose . 
women are much more balance because they don &apos;t share this view that they can create 100 cliffs . 
that means that a lot of people are totally unhappy and skeptical when i &apos;m trying to explain consciousness . 
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to put a plate online , if you work in large amounts . 
we can continue to look for ingredients that we love and talk about our favorite stores for hours . 
just very briefly . remember , they differ from each other in every 300 . base pair apart . 
the hard thing about euopa is that it takes a long time for 27 people to speak at a conference . 
the teacher among us , everyone who has taught , knows that teaching is really about connection . 
when you take children with different backgrounds , and what makes them special is that we create a moment . 
it &apos;s hard , so we had to develop the technologies , and we had to basically put ourselves into a body . 
the exception that it &apos;s not that rich , because they don &apos;t have cerebral cortex like us . 
and we can see the consequences of these mutations , if we compare dna sequences , for example , in this room . 
they didn &apos;t destroy it , it just took a new position , and this new position can be equally beautiful . 
we &apos;re already wired as though we &apos;re in a fiber body , if you will . 
this man , his name was mahmoud , and the child , his name was rafi , went . 
and many of you may have noticed that this doesn &apos;t show as big outcomes , as you might have liked . 
there &apos;s this thing , the militarization of the world , and it comes directly from the middle of the united states . 
the next map shows africa &apos;s gdp of 1960 , roughly at the time in which many african states have been independent . 
and she saw that when there was no inflammation , the scan was actually gray . 
so i went to russia , and my mom was walking , during the time of the soviet union . 
if you look like this , you look in the past , or you look in yourself , if you &apos;re very moving . 
and if you do that , origami is the same size , but our square is at the end of three times the size . 
but there are also countries like guatemala , papua neuguinea , yemen and afghanistan . 
the rabbit itself , the animal -- no cat , no dog , a rabbit -- why a rabbit ? 
see , these corals can be really mean . i have scars of the surf that prove this . 
books saved the introverts , shattering child that i was -- that i was once . 
but i still had a question , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; 
the good side is , i think , a kind of reason for behavioral economics is interesting and exciting . 
we don &apos;t want people to look at our films and say , &quot; that was funny , &quot; and then forget it . 
and i always like to say that she is the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ... 
the cost was enormous -- water pollution , all the things that you know , destruction of our habitat . 
and then this is , then , a young man named willy bohm who worked for usaid . 
the human form , in particular , human head , is considered the sacred grail of the film industry . 
well , on september 4th , there was a great anesthesia , which is what you do with polio . 
and when someone asks why you have a condom , you can just tell , you like the design . 
i know most of you have had the experience of coming home , and your kids are playing those games . 
first , most of you are born in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , under the one-child policy . 
finding our own solutions to solve problems like corruption , build institutions that stabilize micro-economies . 
it grew in my head , and then it &apos;s related to the whole process that i &apos;ve been growing through . 
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick . 
it &apos;s just a combination of things that have been done before , just put together in a different way . 
so they said i &apos;d left this machine to this , which is just in english , so we had to learn english . 
elon musk , i wish we had all day , thank you for coming to ted . 
that &apos;s great , that means there &apos;s going to be 10 billion heads working with each other , 10 billion talents combined . 
we love challenges , but if the expectations are low , believe me , we will only fulfill them . 
the kids are just taking pictures in a class , the teacher gets them , they &apos;re putting them on the walls . 
this is probably the saddest sound i &apos;ve ever heard of an organism , human , or other nature . 
you can recline , and then the camera changes its perspective , depending on which way you &apos;re looking at . 
by the way , the secret is not to go to bed , before you have your words for that day . 
we already have the data that shows that it shrinks the duration of their flu by a few hours . 
i loved to make the book because i loved letting my imagination play , and that &apos;s writing . 
and that allows me to look at the clock without the arm at all . 
they have 22 satellites flipping around at a level of about 100 miles , and the site is red . 
it &apos;s very simple to fall into the decentralized , from below to the top structure of the internet . 
not because it &apos;s cranked before , i &apos;m going to take it , because i &apos;ve made a little computation . 
and there , and only there , you can really feel part of a larger thing , or a larger ecosystem . 
so , practice compassion , read the writing , spreads it , and develop in you . 
of course , at that age , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her , i feel lousy in the space . 
and i realized that i had come across something that was huge potential to change the world . 
people who are listening colorful are actually seeing colors when they perceive the sounds of words or letters . 
most of the cars i drive start rats when i take 80 miles per hour . 
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a brilliant team taking care of the software . 
i have to mention that before i got to the united states , i had never recognized myself as an african . 
people who need a voice should know that most of the computers are already involved in language technology . 
it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether it &apos;s mountain bike or reading a book or playing a game . 
and then i think the other thing is that today , far more agreed with globalization . 
now , fashion designers have the widest palette that you can imagine in the creative industry . 
i go around and i encourage you , &quot; go , go , &quot; you have to write like a crazy or two hours . 
we also believe that individuals can make a difference , and we should also , because they can help build a movement together . 
maybe you , maybe i -- but we &apos;re not here to act with opinions , everybody has an opinion . 
now i thought , if you do good science , that changes medical care , but it was a little bit naive . 
silk . make a product that doesn &apos;t have to be cooled next to the milk on the fridge . 
i should not run the gang long and say , &quot; hi , jack ! &quot; i know that &apos;s not cool . 
and so , at the micro-level , there is a role for this combination of investment and philanthropy . 
i think , usually when companies get bigger , they find it very difficult to do small , innovative projects . 
i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that at the end , that &apos;s the wrong question , is that it &apos;s not the major question . 
so every time you &apos;ve found something that looked a little bit different , you &apos;ve given that one other name . 
this is a mouse that was created by charles vacanti at the university of massachusetts . 
just look at the map of google here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . 
it has converted the music industry . it has changed the way we consume music . 
and you can interact with your neighbors a lot , with people you like , with people you might not even know about . 
but the way that people tell stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty . 
from which we were talking , my friends in brazil , how we can scale the model in china and brazil . 
and i want to conclude with the question of what will be the next story in which this object will emerge . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last demonstration , but first i want to thank you , and still very small thinking . 
again , it &apos;s completely interactive , you can turn it and look at things in real time on these systems . 
that &apos;s the challenge . ok , now let &apos;s look at the journey of the wheat , and look at these 12 conditions . 
for the first time , i &apos;ve wanted to meet people for a long time , and i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and even see them live . 
meanwhile , i played in the neighborhood with my band , the dresden dollar , in the night club club . 
so , and this song is about how elusive everybody is because , you know , we &apos;re coming from russia . 
and that &apos;s one thing that makes their piano teachers teach them , but there was never a science about these things . 
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government has a key role in developing technologies . 
and what we &apos;re seeing here is the emergence of the gases methane , ch4 , in the atmosphere of mars . 
a culture that is being controlled from above , where the vocal cords are lost by millions . 
finally , she says , &quot; mom , do you think there are people on the internet as well as people who mate ? &quot; 
and i think this has been the fundamental problem for the last 50 years , that we &apos;ve wanted to understand what cancer is . 
car-sharing services are now emerging all over the world , these efforts , i think , are great . 
but with structures that combine instead of separate , circles that depend on each other rather than isolating triangles . 
and the latest thing i &apos;m working on is what &apos;s really -- i don &apos;t know what it is . 
he knows a world , and he finds a way to communicate this in another world , because he has both deep connections . 
what did we do then ? i met nice people , like you , who invited us into the hampton . 
but because transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , we &apos;re increasingly seeing they &apos;re not acting like that anymore . 
today , i &apos;m going to tell you two things : first , what we &apos;ve lost , and second , how we regain it . 
if we ask them questions and tell them what we need , one of my worry is that there are so many organizations today . 
the women are coming for treatment , but we know , a test and the delivery of a drug is not enough . 
you can look at the patient , you can go through all the controls . you can look at them , you can ask them . 
and we do something different than what we &apos;ve done in the past . we &apos;re going to add a minimum of intelligence there . 
in fact , even in the ancient world , the solar system , in a way , looked like this graph . 
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to get me to . because i &apos;m a godless person . 
and it &apos;s too cerebral to animate courage and hearts and behavior , turning hard on hard . 
the printer that you see here has printed this kidney structure that i showed you before . 
so what we &apos;ve done in the united states is we &apos;ve been looking at the data endlessly checking the data . 
just this little bit of money that i wish i had on my bank account -- not unfortunately , but ... 
and yet , even though john was doing everything really well , he had problems , he was struggling with dependency and severe depression . 
it &apos;s essentially a song about loops , but not the kind of loops i &apos;m creating here . 
even though it &apos;s true , you know , the reason i &apos;m speaking to you is because i was born in brazil . 
this was bruno bowden , who &apos;s here today . world record . em : heart wish . 
what you &apos;re seeing here in black lines is the safe space , the quantified boundaries , proposed by this analysis . 
another scientist , if he or she &apos;s making a discovery , it &apos;s usually not knowing what applications might come out of it . 
that sounds good , but deep inside , you know , it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;m also saying why . 
you know these cells , because they &apos;re the ones that you frustrate when you try to make a dead bug . 
it &apos;s particularly focused on japan , korea and australia , the countries that are closely allies in the united states . 
so it started out with the work that i did in ireland , where i was teaching , and has been spreading since then . 
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my great pleasure to share two examples with you . 
in terms of college , there are 350 unis in the world teaching video games . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to find the way to get there , because i don &apos;t want that story to go away . &quot; 
the other part of the good news , at least for the scientists , is that there &apos;s still a lot to be discovered . 
there are a lot of things that i think can predict from the approach that i &apos;ve followed , and some that don &apos;t work for . 
why not ? it &apos;s possible . look around here -- all this knowledge , this energy , this talent and this technology . 
so we thought we could use this idea to see if we could predict phenomena in networks . 
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s october 10 . and i said , &quot; what ? &quot; 
if you actually look at the registers , you can see that a lot of the stuff in the e.u. reported things . 
at the time , i realized that i wanted to go on a journey to see what men are doing today to create for themselves . 
i think the concept of a global citizenship is just going to evolve from people talking across continents across each other . 
and our whole body , everything -- the hair , skin , nails -- is made of collagen . 
and so one of the ways that we explored the ocean was the acoustics , which is sound waves . 
as bill mcdonough has noticed , the objects we buy and use have hidden consequences . 
and this man , archie cochrane , is a prisoner and a doctor , and he &apos;s got a problem . 
and those galaxies that have much less dark energy collapsing so fast in themselves that no galaxies form . 
it &apos;s not about buying 100 or 1,000 . i &apos;m going to invite you to do that , and 10,000 would actually be better . 
one person interacting with the robot , reaching where it &apos;s going to reach and is not surprised by his movements . 
the kindness and kindness in her face immediately took me on her , and i asked her to tell me her story . 
this is not a fiction , not a fairy tale , it &apos;s not a fantasy ; it &apos;s insensitive , sharp science . 
i &apos;m going to show you a computer model of iain couzine , a researcher in oxford , which shows how swarms work . 
this is a device that doesn &apos;t just measure the heart rhythm , as you &apos;ve seen , it can do much more . 
this is what happened in different opportunities , but i think it was a big advantage to be a woman . 
we paid them 10 cents a real question , 50 cents , one dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars a real question . 
i &apos;m going to talk about some of the problems that we face , and some of the problems that we &apos;re working on for solutions . 
so there &apos;s more and more activity going on next to the boat , and suddenly someone calls , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot; 
we show a manifestation of something that really matters . it &apos;s a part of our identity , but no one can own . 
so finally , we have to ask a lot of questions , and as i said , we &apos;re going to ask questions here , we &apos;re not going to answer them . 
we &apos;ve made a survey that confirms that 45 percent of the people in a major demographic group in the u.s . 
and later , about 100,000 to 50,000 years ago , they left africa to colonize the rest of the world . 
and then , what world population would make a balance that could exist , by 2050 , 2100 , 2150 ? 
more like a phenomenon works , therotic physicists are always interested in , &quot; why &quot; it works , &quot; how &quot; it works . 
i tried to challenge anyone i could against who , against the runners , who i am against ? 
and then , because the juveniles are in my collection , i cut them up and i looked at the inner . 
what suggests is that even if you lose hearing , the ability of the brain to process music . 
and mothers are scraping for their children so they can tell me , and they say , &quot; don &apos;t stare ! &quot; 
and i think , if we look at culture , we &apos;re also somehow beginning to understand how we &apos;ve become the way we are . 
our inability to reach our initiative and to the people who make money , to say , &quot; sit down . &quot; 
a wise person knows how to improvise , how luke did it when he knocked the ground twice . 
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re used in the experiment that i &apos;m going to tell you about , prints of monet &apos;s pictures . 
so these are the images that he had filmed , and they were quite moving and terrifying . 
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear whether we have control over it . 
but i also learned very quickly that jesus said , and i realize that always poor people are going to be below us . 
they don &apos;t run 42 kilometers , but 150 , 250 kilometers in the piece , and apparently without injuries , without problems . 
it doesn &apos;t always work on self-interest , because when emotions come into play , the interactions change how it works . 
you have to pay for your soap , your deo , your toothbrush , your toothpaste -- for everything . 
and the second one is about a new dimension that i want to talk about , which has never been in the form of today . 
you know , what i love with is , for example , if you look at the biggest eye there , there are so many houses in there . 
now , the first time you look at this , you ask yourself , &quot; oh my god . how can you come out of reality ? &quot; 
like saddam , like pattern , like kim jong-il , are machthbut that kill thousands or millions . 
and i realized something else about this , which is that , on a bad day , it &apos;s extremely difficult to record that one second . 
so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i had to be proud of being part of this story . 
i &apos;ve always thought that my first bowery poetry club was , but it &apos;s possible that it was a lot earlier . 
what it might mean , that moment , for cultural movements everywhere , that &quot; me , &quot; seems to be incredibly important to predict . 
unfortunately , it was the last thing she said to him . she never saw him again . he didn &apos;t survive . 
so the last thing i want to say is that we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have . 
but we should ask the question , whether we &apos;re seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and the way we process data . 
this is &quot; 6,500 yards , &quot; to carot . &quot; &quot; &quot; 9,000 yards , &quot; to gerhard judge . 
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and there is a state in the middle . 
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to pick up a song , you needed a studio and a producer . 
most carefully testing , again testing , design , we &apos;re going to gain new insight , complexity and hard things better explore . 
it had something to do with being raised in a family where no one was speaking english , couldn &apos;t read english or writing english . 
there &apos;s the side that fights and there &apos;s a side that keeps schools and factories and hospitals open . 
it &apos;s beautiful . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge copyright violation , but it &apos;s pretty sophisticated . 
so , the contribution of culture , if culture shapes us what it does , it changes us by changing our brains . 
this is a version of 20 men to get to jupiter : kojen , shelter , practice space . 
a victory in thousands of competitions , three major civil rights laws , health insurance for older , educational supports . 
it means that we can also do things if we take the things we take for granted , we can &apos;t be available . 
it &apos;s been past eight years , and i can say so much that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a lawyer . 
i mean , it would be benefit to experience our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness . 
they &apos;ve all seen that . and this is the melody , which is the most frequent thing in the world right now . 
but i love to explore all possibilities , hoping that you &apos;re on the same wavelength as your audience . 
and then god looked into the future and realized that if the world were just created with justice , it could not exist . 
other examples that you can see here are from lettland , purchases , estonia -- the middle european countries . 
so let &apos;s make a movement in less than three minutes , from the beginning to the end , observe , and make some lessons from it . 
i &apos;m hooked , because i know that i lose the relationship to reality , i still want more and more . 
i mean , how is a device built for accounting and artillery into a medium ? 
particle masses , the strength of the forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by these extra dimensions . 
so if we wanted to design a perfect cochlear implant , we would try and reach that it can transmit music . 
we live among these men : they are our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us . 
so , i was a little bit scared , because if you see these three problems , they seem to be really hard to fight . 
it &apos;s more expensive to transport . the warning prices increase , that affects inflation .

imagine driving through the fog -- it makes a difference whether you see the car in front of you and avoid the crash , or whether you have an accident .

often , we hope that it &apos;s all evolved as we wish it , but we don &apos;t want to do that , to make those wishes come true .

as a free download . thank you , craig mundie , you &apos;ll find it on the website of worldwide telescope.org , which is something new . 
we thought of an application to increase the tablet , and let me show you what we could simulate what we could do , each of us in a museum . 
studies of the roof structure , which may require new materials : so that you can maneuver it , translucent , enlightening , and not impairing . 
because when this happens , i think we can feel free to be more just and more creative to act with each other and to help each other . 
and then when we start to define the meaning of &quot; steep , &quot; we realize that it would be nice to have some measures to really narrow what it means . 
it &apos;s part of our human dna , and maybe it &apos;s time that our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance societies , we start to count on the power of hope . 
a world graphics center -- you can imagine news , messages , noises , images being delivered at every point in the world , instantaneously and wireless . 
and that combination , that cumulative technology , fascinates me , because i think the mystery is because it is , if you want to understand what &apos;s going on in the world . 
why ? because we know what they have , and we know how to treat it , even though we can &apos;t make a vaccine here , but that &apos;s a different story . 
now , i &apos;m not going to explain the physical part of it , but all you have to know is that the faster the magnet falls , the bigger the power is the power of it .

but i also think there is a climate crisis that is also very serious , which is the same root , and we have to deal with the same urgency . 
so what i &apos;m looking at is really saying that for a very long time , we &apos;ve had a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices .

the dystopie , which frightens me , is a universe where some geniuses invent things like google and the rest of us are paid to mask them . 
i remember -- natasha didn &apos;t want us to open the door -- i didn &apos;t want to open the door because as long as we needed to boom .

and when i was doing this , i realized , when i was doing this , we were talking about one of the great ted talks about the past , nathan , about an active tail . 
world &apos;s population , pc-plates , the archives of all the medical literature , moore &apos;s law , the old way of sequencing , and here are all new things . 
that &apos;s what happened to me when i realized we &apos;re moving away from passive consumers to highly highly active collaborators . 
so , we &apos;re going to fly to mars one day , and if we do that , the unfair will be to the people who live with such ridiculous names . 
so despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that is supermassive , and i &apos;m about to get to what it really means , it doesn &apos;t have a finite size . 
but there &apos;s a huge amount of people out there who tell you that they have supersensory , magical forces , that they predict the future that they make contact with the dead .

and the oceans are so productive , it &apos;s happening so much that it matters to people that we necessarily need to , even from a selfish perspective , better than we have to do so far . 
you can see lidonard proven that goes through here , which is tribeca today , and the beaches of battery park are highly walking all the way down to 42d street . 
and the species in the ground are doing a good job , and they &apos;re putting these roots well , they &apos;re degrading -- the rainworms , fungi , bacteria -- and the result is new soil . 
of course , they think of pictures that can be sensory patterns , visually , how they have now , in relation to the stage and me , or auditory images that they have in connection to my words . 
i &apos;m fascinated with the idea of what happens when you mix biology with technology , and i read about the idea of encoding biology in the future , far from disease and aging .

i &apos;ve also been working in other parts of new zealand , in beautiful , fragilen , protected areas , for example , in fiordland , where i found this colony of sea feathers . 
and so i was so easily transformed by a woman who had been taught to think of these children as &quot; disabled &quot; in somebody who had a potential that their bodies haven &apos;t had . 
but if you look in the eye of consciousness , the single eye you see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me explain how i felt at that moment . 
in india , the first year of life , between zero and one , girls and boys survive in the same proportion , because they get breast , and they don &apos;t prefer breast sons . 
you set up a telescope in the sky , you make a picture , you find out what stars are and erase those galaxies , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and mark them . 
all i can do is hope , not in policymakers and politicians , because i &apos;d like to believe that you read my words and do something , i don &apos;t deceive myself . 
if i could reveal something that hidden us , at least in modern cultures , it would be something we forgot that we used to know our own names . 
one of the key reasons it &apos;s so difficult to talk about the problem , and generally i think that &apos;s why it &apos;s been political unacceptable to talk about it . 
were we all a result of the things that have been approached to us , things that have been done for us , the faiths of a parent or a shadow , forgive money ?

as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- you have to inspire to do more work than ever before in your life , under conditions that you can &apos;t imagine . 
and then the wider ideas of urban development start to have direct impact on architecture , to the elements that create the wider scheme , the buildings themselves , and guide us . 
every time she gets to the center , she stays , carefully examines the scaffolding of the scaffold as though she was going to sniff out the environment , and then she turns around . 
but it was pretty obvious , it was pretty obvious that for this particular track that i had chosen , the farther the school was removed , the results in order to be so bad . 
it was in a sense , in the mcluhan &apos; sense , an external stomach , in the sense that it was cooking , in the case we couldn &apos;t eat otherwise . 
we want to build technological artifacts that could be used for the world . we want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like humans , whales and trees . 
i think politicians can help encourage non-zero-sum relationships , you know , economic engagement is usually better than blocking and so on , in that sense , i think . 
and within the jewish teaching , in the rabbinic teaching , we have hellel who says that you shouldn &apos;t do anything else you don &apos;t want to do . 
i &apos;ve seen incredible places here . countries like mongolei , cambodia , new guinea , south africa , twice tanzania ; i was here one month ago . 
and i think the reason it has is that thousands of years of history don &apos;t turn itself around without much pain , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m talking about it all in common . 
and if you &apos;re lost from your eyes , where you &apos;re in your biosphere , or you &apos;re not aware of the link that &apos;s between you and the biosphere , i propose that you &apos;re breathing deep .

you need some water , you have the nanotubes inside , and the antibodies , and you mix the whole thing , you get some paper , you dive in and you dry it , and you can detect cancer . 
but the key here , the reason these groups can connect with each other is because their work belongs to the kind of work that can be easily divided -- a picture , a music file , software . 
it may be , as if you &apos;re struggling with multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get healthy . you could die . but if you just suffer from disease , the state can be improved . 
when we got there , we just went to the street , we started talking to people everywhere , and we realized that things were a little bit different than the phrases that we heard in the media . 
it &apos;s really good tax . there &apos;s a portable remote control that you can speed up , break , change the trajectory , also with brake function . 
so i want you to imagine a world where we have better quality of air quality in which the quality of life is better and in which the quality of life is better for all of us , also for our future generations . 
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by posting a force that &apos;s much more complex , and just getting the problem upset . 
and finally , i want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to make that sense behind you , and that this , if you can , is the largest moral , intellectual and creative leap that you can do . 
so one of our passions in our company is , and now one of my personal passions , being able to work really hard to make technologies useful , accessible and affordable .

anyway , you want that , voluntary , try to change your life . worldwide , there are communities in america and japan -- incredible , right ? imagine : america , japan and new zealand . 
i &apos;m also so surprised , because when i look back at my life , the last thing i ever wanted to do was write about religion , or being involved in a form of religion .

and as i circled these dark clouds , and i found it very , very difficult to think of anything good at all , i said that i really have to find a way to focus on something positive .

and we had to be sure that brad &apos;s features , his special corners and hostiles that would make him , who he is , would remain in the process , so that they would appear in the digital benjamin . 
so we go &quot; sit , &quot; sit on the couch , &quot; sit , &quot; and we stroke , &quot; sit , &quot; look , i &apos;ll get a tennis ball , sit , greet the other dog . 
they bring the water , they bring the soap , i wash the clothes for you , calculate 50 paisa , a corruption to you , depending on charge , and this is how a new business model can come .

haiti rewired , with build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , is possible to get 30,000 , 40,000 walls across the country and start a movement for the right way to build .

i &apos;m going to get you to do some math as well -- so i &apos;m going to get you to understand this language that allows us to understand what symmetry is . 
and if we have only enough of these people , we want more fany artists that can map places where we &apos;ve never been before , or characters that we &apos;ve never seen before . 
you know that what you have to do is you can also be done , even though it &apos;s hard , and the amount of time goes away , you forget about yourself , you feel larger than part of something . 
is it the influence ? we have professors from mit , from berkeley , stanford , from the indian science institute , who are coming and teaching our kids to form a lot of scientific forms , experiments that go way beyond normal schooling . 
but i want to try and make it a little different , and that is , by trying to close the circle with some personal stories , i can maybe make a lot of the topics that we &apos;ve talked about , a little bit more accomplished . 
that &apos;s the real value , the encounter , when you produce something in a factory and you deliver a service , and then there &apos;s sort of a doubt value that you create when you change the way people view things . 
and we were grateful for getting pregnant again , and soon after that , i learned that it was going to be a boy , and then when i was five months old , we learned that we had lost our child . 
they &apos;re both carbon , and yet one of the two carbon atoms that are arranged in a particular way , on the left , and they get graphite , which is soft and dark . 
and this is an idea that , as i think , paul richard buchanan said very nice in a current essay , where he says , &quot; products are living arguments for how we should live our lives . &quot; 
we know what it &apos;s like when these guys on tv , they collapse in congress , that the end of the world is naked , if we don &apos;t really agree with their opinion , because that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to the dollar since there &apos;s dollar . 
so , you take the drop of blood , without any processing , you put it into a little device , the device filters the blood cells out , and you get the serum , and you get a series of colors down there . 
if nothing else goes , you get a dog . no cat , you get a dog when you walk out for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;d been getting away for six months when you get to five minutes . 
it can be a design school in jerusalem , trying to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because as you know , israel per person , including babies , a gas mask . 
i just want to tell you that the reason for this development is that the lawyers in these processes have understood that the more they engage in one case , the bigger the possibility of saving their clients &apos; lives . 
there are two types of errors that you do when you try to decide what &apos;s the right thing , and these are : error in estimating success , and error in estimating the value of success . 
in a small country -- whether i was going to , whether i was going to , you know , this story -- the fact story -- that all government decisions , the discussions of the ministers , 24 hours after they had happened were supposed to be publicly published on the internet . 
the pink pakiano restaurant , where he brings us to the beaches of acapulko , up at the top of the upper west side , with this wall full of fellows that -- you see it , that &apos;s exactly the way . 
they were born in stars like this , including and then given back to the universe , in explosions like this , to deny again and form planets , stars , new solar systems , and truly , humans like us . 
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism fit all together into a package , but only when the universe has more dimensions than the one we see . 
another thing that allows us to do with information technologies is that we start to figure out how to do less things , by understanding the amount of things we actually use , humbling knowledge , and also controlling them exactly . 
hopefully , we would understand the clients inside where it &apos;s home , by living with it in america . and so -- we sent the team off , and then actually something else happened . they took their own journey . 
and this bone is full of light , as you can see , light that shines through the skull , with all its depths , the side caves , the air heating and firing , that we inhale . 
as i said , i &apos;ve traveled to many countries , and i &apos;ve seen when we do with the girl in us what we do , it &apos;s obviously terrifying to think about what we do to the girls in the world . 
this was flushed , but there was nothing in the world that my sister wanted more than amy to be the last five year-old little sister , but amy , the mysterious unicorn . 
and it &apos;s about two anectodes -- one was in cambodia , in a village that has no electricity , water , tv or telephone , but now has broadband connection . 
huntington kitchen . in huntington , where i &apos;ve done this show , you know , we &apos;re making this program at the best time , hopefully people will make this change happen . 
the people in the modern , secular world , who are very interested in spiritual issues , for the issues of consciousness , for the higher , more secure problematic , are quite often isolated creatures . 
we had fashion designers , installation camps , models , we had masking imagery , jewely designers , all kinds of people working with me to make an art installation from my wedding . 
we couldn &apos;t believe it could . it tells us that if you could build a robot with very simple , federing legs , you could make it as agile as anything that has been built so far . 
instead , all the big threats of today are problems that we &apos;ve all created , and since we &apos;ve created the problems , we can solve them , and that means that it &apos;s completely in our power to tackle these problems . 
that is , the work of innovation , the work of developing new ideas is one of the most powerful , one of the most fundamental work we can do in a economies , and that &apos;s how they used to innovate . 
evolution was the same thing . we were teaching our kids , the bible says , god has created all these species , cats are cats , dogs , people are dogs , people , plants are plants , and they &apos;re not changing . 
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take some pictures of flowers in a garden into a computer system so that it looked like there was a real robot , although no one is there . 
so we called it y water . so this is another example where it all happens together in one room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the progression of the brand , it &apos;s all very closely interconnected . 
&quot; i think it &apos;s great that they &apos;ve managed to preserve most of what makes you feel connected to nature -- butterflies , man-made woods , limestone caves and hey , even a giant python . &quot; 
that as we explore these strands of a &apos;s , t &apos;s c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we could discover a whole new class of life that , like beijerinck , will change the way we think about the nature of biology . 
we &apos;ve never seen such a clear decline in ecosystems features and features of the planet that are the ability to regulate the climate in the long term , in our forests , landscapes and biodiversity . 
i say the guy , when they &apos;re fighting up the mountain , and they don &apos;t feel that it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise the head , to look around and see how the view is going up around you . 
so the challenge was to get them to do what we wanted them to do , through weather observation , the nature of the soil and through things that make the sheep flow , so they went where we wanted to go . 
they would stack us up very amazingly , if we spend time listening to a nice performance like the one we just heard -- because of people doing stupid movements , and they would be really irritated and wouldn &apos;t see what &apos;s going on with us . 
in fact , she said that if we did that , it would not only make us joyful that the extended family was thankful , but she said , &quot; even god will smile , and when god smiles , that is peace , justice and joy . &quot; 
you know , i know , i &apos;m so bad at technology that i &apos;m doing my daughter -- who &apos;s 41 -- when she was five , she heard a friend say , &quot; if she doesn &apos;t bloop , if you cut it , then my dad doesn &apos;t understand it . &quot; 
the company instructions took our pile , our list of incentives , and left the room for 17 minutes , and said to come back , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the most generous thing a community has ever done to keep the jobs there . 
we &apos;re going to need to learn again , what are the single building blocks of these things : the streets , the block , how to create a public space that is equally large and small , and the courtyard , and the public space , and how to use these facilities best . 
so first of all , if you &apos;re a character like the dancing guy without a shirt who is dancing alone , think of the importance of looking at your first followers as an equal , so it &apos;s clearly about movement , not about you . 
the best thing we can do is to find ways to find the business spirit and the vast , unused potential for our prisons , because if we don &apos;t do that , they won &apos;t learn anything new to them and they &apos;re going to be prone . 
a way to deal with the creation of the modern world could be politics , and unfortunately you can have humane moral principles , you can classify logic on abstractions , but if you don &apos;t know the history and other countries , you can &apos;t do politics . 
and to try this out -- i couldn &apos;t find a sponsor , but i went to manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have toilets , beyond the exhibition room , which you can use , what i &apos;ve done . 
she gave them a book about life in the south that they were left behind , &quot; they were sitting around , reading the book , reading me out of the book , and a piece of paradise was reclaimed . &quot; 
anyway , i mean that an alternative primary education , whatever it is that it will take to imagine where no schools exist , where schools aren &apos;t good enough , where schools are not available , or where teachers aren &apos;t good enough for whatever reason they are . 
and then we become the fish , after that , the frog , then we become the monkey , and then we become what we are today : a supermonkey , and the funny thing is that our current state is only half the story . 
we have a lot of energy , so we &apos;re going to solve this problem , but biology is hot , because we &apos;re going to spit all these toxic materials that we spit out through the system , we &apos;re never going to be doing it well again . 
i think there are new hidden tensions that actually play between people and institutions -- institutions that people use in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , jobs , business , offices , and so on . 
for me , what that means is that you see the value of the difference , the joy that it brings to you , if we don &apos;t focus on loss and limitation , but the power and joy and discover the world from new exciting perspectives . 
there &apos;s this amazing thing called youtube . we can basically go deep and get all the content out of youtube , all the comments , all the visitors who she looks at where she &apos;s going to look at them and what &apos;s being said in the comments . 
and i used cargo containers and students helped build furniture , to make them habit , and everything is the budget of the government , the area that takes home is the same , but it &apos;s much more livable . 
and what the bayes-rule says is that you should multiply the number in red by the number of green to get the number of yellow that have ellipse , and that &apos;s my belief . 
but if we reverse this formula very quickly , what we get is that acceleration is the same as a force divided by mass , which means that you need for a larger particle , you need a larger mass , you need more force to change the direction . 
everybody knows that we can better deal with visual things that the patient can use interactive with , where you can see a video , and you can film a video , and you can press buttons . right ? no , i don &apos;t . 
newton aduaka : thank you . i have only -- the first excerpt , of these incisions , is really trying to capture what cinema means to me , and how i do anything about the cinema . 
and if you think it really doesn &apos;t matter to you , then remember cloning is possible , and that means that you go back through childhood , in which case you want to be heard , as i think , my generation wants to . 
this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also the designers that work on this elasticity as a chance , and it &apos;s not just the designers , but the scientists are also . 
doug hofstadter asks , well , maybe our intelligence is just not big enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , our brain would be more complex , and we could never keep up with it . 
so we grew up thinking that no one would ever love us to be lonely , no one ever makes us feel like the sun is something that they built us in their shoes . 
if we can break that boundary , this impairment , that tension , that feeling that we don &apos;t work sufficiently in terms of social problems ; we can break it through and ultimately , i think , we &apos;ll find solutions . 
everything started when two scientists , fred grassle and jesse ausubel , in woods hole , massachusetts , when both came to the famous oceanographic institute . 
in many cases , this is not so much about changing something , it &apos;s more about trying to create the conditions under which change is possible , and to incentivize , to change a change , which is easier than to do in rural communities and in closed education systems in rural communities . 
what i propose is , as we read , we ask arithmetics and american history , we should have a curriculum about the facts of all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their credo , about their texts , their music , their symbols , their needs . 
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her looking at me at a party , how she melted drunk , dropped , lifted , shrinted rock , red surrounded eyes , want to disappear from tears , her shame . 
dean ornish shares new findings of research that show how the propensity of healthy life can affect a human at a genetic level , and he says , for example , when we live healthier , eat better , exercise and our own brain cells actually reproduce . 
rob forbes , founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of snapshots that illustrate his way to look at the world . charming facets , found art , urban patterns -- this presentation will open your eyes around the world . 
i didn &apos;t even have a precise address , but i knew that he was called abed , and i knew that he lived in a city with 15,000 people called kfar kara , and i knew that 21 years earlier , outside of that holy city , he had broken my neck . 
and i would say we can &apos;t give up the rule , we can &apos;t fight asymmetric threats , which we seem to do because of the events that people are doing , because that was to give up the one thing that makes civilization . 
the problem was , after doing it this for a few years , i realized that maybe i was at six or seven programs , and you know , i thought , if i keep doing this at this pace , i &apos;m going to go all my career for maybe 20 or 30 printers . 
you decode what you want to fold together , into a sequence of angles -- so minus 120 , minus 120 , zero , 120 , 120 , minus 120 -- something like a sequence of angles , or files , and you send that sequence through the chain . 
science and ethics , the citizens of a democracy , are not just related , but there &apos;s also , historically , a relationship between how people think about time and space and what the cosmos think , and how people think about society , where they live . 
the adoption process took a couple of months , it was an industry , you know , a defeated business , a distribution , useful solution : the government as a farmer , the optics parents , the mother , the earth , the child who harvested . 
but since we ate all the oysters , and all the fish that was going to eat the plankton is nothing more than what &apos;s eating the plankton , and so there &apos;s more and more of it , so there &apos;s an aging weakness , which you &apos;ve never heard of plankton . 
so you can buy apps , and you can buy apps in that application , but if you think about amazon , you also think about the confidence ometer that i showed you , loud people start chewing , corporations more , particularly companies that you believe in as governments . 
so it &apos;s very clear that in the face of these numbers , or all the other figures i &apos;m talking about in my book , &quot; world 3.0 , &quot; which is very , very far from the fall-sized boundaries that i &apos;ve seen , the international level at 85 , 90 percent , 95 percent . 
summer &apos;s time , and life is easy to jump the fish , and the cotton is already up to oh , your dad &apos;s rich , and your mom looks good , my little baby doesn &apos;t cry ! and when i opened my eyes , i saw that the woman had closed her eyes . 
and now let me become less sentimental and say that life rescues -- what some help we get from this continent -- when you save a life , that a farmer , a teacher , a mother , these people can all be productive about the economy . 
and this has led to a view of human nature that we are rational individuals that are responding in a straight way in rewards , and that has led to points of the world where people are trying to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior works . 
and like a living organism , where , when you pull it up , the melted blood strip , which , to heal the wound , you get out of the asthenosphere , hacks , forming new tissues , moving sideways . 
but this ... process is what i consider as a science process , where you start with an idea , and then , instead of just proposing every authority that you &apos;ve ever heard of , you sometimes do this , when you write an article later , you want to figure out who else has been working on it . 
and in the next 25 years , i lived in italy , i lived in america , i kind of divided parts of this romance to anyone who was paying for it , this sense , this aesthetic sense , for the experience of a design nobject . 
but what i have to do now is , when i feel again , what i have to do , i have to be able to send enough of these enzymes from these extinctions , early enough in the process that they arrive with them , not by their thinking , but by their feeling . 
if you look at the economy from both these different angles , you can understand why this crisis is so difficult , the worse the crisis , the higher the sentences , the more it believes every page , just knowing the answer , and the other side will only ruin . 
there &apos;s this big , concentrated agriculture that has led to what we &apos;re eating in america , and it &apos;s really been around 1980 , after the oil crisis , as you know , mass collectors , mass exodus of small farmers in this country . 
but at least in a great class of cases , you can expect the universe to be a kind of network that , if it &apos;s large enough , like an infinite space , you have a lot of molecules that act like a fluid . 
two minutes lead to these hormone changes that shape your brain so that you &apos;re either determined to be self-conscious and comfortable , or that you &apos;re very stressful , and you feel like you have no energy . we all know that feeling , right ? 
when the paper burned , he turned to me for some reason , and he said , &quot; mashelkar , so if you don &apos;t deny your energy , if you focus your energy , you can do anything in the world . &quot; 
you see an animation going from one example of what you would see without the use of the experience , in other words , is just a picture that shows the stars , and the frame is centrated with the center of the galaxy , where we suspect the black hole . 
and the scale of my work , the ideas that i work with when i first saw an imax film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there is a resonance between what i want to do , and the scale of what i want to do as a photographer . &quot; 
in fact , it &apos;s easier to think of ourselves , the citizens , the police , the army , the army , as the good news , and the druggers and the cardals , as the bad as the bad guys , let &apos;s think that they &apos;re offering one service to the others . 
what &apos;s actually happening is that what was happening before was local vulnerability , individuals or groups of extremists , who were isolated by each other are now connected in a globalized way and became so , or , in that way , or are being established in that way . 
with that same persistence that my father had raised me since i was little -- he taught me about sailing , although he knew i could never see where i was going , never see the bank , or the sailing , never the destination . 
and it &apos;s crucial in a practical and activist sense that people who deal with these issues make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they practice their preferences and their voice to support one such outcome . 
but if you look at the map and you see our state of michigan here -- it &apos;s legal to firing people because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , it &apos;s legal to throw someone out of their home because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , you can see that all of the equality about marriage is not about protecting someone &apos;s rights , but it &apos;s to give them the right to their right . 
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that evening , she called him up , she left a message -- true story -- to the top of the world trade center , where he was working , &quot; honey , i love you . i want you to know i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; and she sleeped because it was three o &apos;clock for us when he returned from the top and said , &quot; i can &apos;t tell you what that means to me . &quot; 
i used to say that these people rescued me , but now i know that they &apos;ve done something much more important than they enabled me to save myself , and , more importantly , they helped me understand something that i always thought was a sensual reaction to traumatic life , especially childhood experiences , and therefore my enemies , but were a cognitive source of unresolved problems . 
and what i &apos;ve been trying to do since i was trained as a medical illustrator -- since i &apos;ve been taught by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual adviser , was taught in animation -- is to find a way to help people understand the truth and beauty of biological sciences -- through animation , through stories , so things that don &apos;t necessarily seem obvious to be brought up and taught and understood . 
i had a graduate laboratory to answer this question , which is , what is the difference in somebody &apos;s life , if you look at one of the people you &apos;ve given everything ? how all the resources they give to . no cheap computer , you &apos;ve given them the best calculator . you gave them love , you gave them love , you gave them pleasure . you were to comfort them . 
this is a call for all the things that we love about mexico -- the fixed , the markets , the restaurants , the bars , the tequila , the mariachi , the serenmen , the posadas , el grito , the dead , san miguel , the joy of life , the lust and everything that it means to be mexican -- not from that world . 
i led to our medical school university , the carolinska institute , a class called the world health center , but if you get that opportunity , you get something nervous . i said , the students who come to us have the best degree you can get in the swedish high school system , and you might know what i want to teach you . so i &apos;ve got the best way to teach you . 
in fact , we think it &apos;s feasible to reach 100 percent , even before 2015 . in other parts of the emerging markets , such as india and china , there were good advances -- the stable ones were good , but in no developed areas , like africa , latin america and other regions of the world , they were rather slow . i just visited just recently south africa . 
when people are asked about these two different locations , one where they &apos;re getting 60 thousand , and they &apos;re going to make 50 , and they &apos;re going to make 4,000 , one where they get half a year , and one in which they get a salary cave , people might rather than the first , although they were told they were making a lot less money . why ? 
and it &apos;s a sense that urges me to be here today . the knowledge that we prescribe women , as an ambassador for all of this , but also as those who have the responsibility for the children , and as mothers , we have the greatest purchase in our household . it &apos;s to go ahead and do the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world . 
so what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken some of the money that we &apos;ve collected in australia to bring the campaign to this country to the united states and to england , and we &apos;ve done this because we knew that if it was successful , we could collect an infinite amount more money worldwide than just in australia , and the money is pushing the research and this research will bring us into a cure . 
and it &apos;s interesting , when you think about it , how , when you think about the civilizations that we consider as peaks of human achievement , whether this is china , greece , the civilization of hindus , or the mayas , the egyptians , what we know about them , is about their ecstases , and not about their everyday life . 
between australia and here , right , we have summer and we have winter , and what -- sort of , the earth sort of scraps out in the night of the sun , and then returned ? i mean , that &apos;s a funny thing that &apos;s going on there , and we &apos;ve got these two models in the head of what &apos;s right and what &apos;s not , and we &apos;re doing that as humans , in all sorts of different places . 
there are three trucks . you instinctively take the white truck , because that &apos;s the top truck in your view . but you will remember , &quot; oh , he doesn &apos;t see him , so i should move the blue trucks , &quot; the top of his perspective . don &apos;t believe it or normal , healthy adults , like you do in half the time you make errors in these tests . 
and i arrange them . and , well , it &apos;s also slightly different , because an architect in comparison , let &apos;s say , a dance group , after all , is a negotiation between the private world , the worlds of their concepts , the ideas , the yearning , the inventions , the relationship to the outside world and all the constraints , the constraints . 
because if you spend a lot of time going from place to place , from country to country , from town to city , the scale of women , being abused , and the epidemic of it , and the ordinary thing about it is so devastating to the soul that you have to take the time , at least i have to take time to process that . 
in those days , there were even rural areas , near the city , the caves , the grain fields , cows , even though not far from our house , with his siblings of rocks and the long , sharp corridor , you could find areas with hills and trees , and you could do that as being mountains and forests . 
what &apos;s important here is that , if you start to look at the people with these disorders , the one in the fifth , the one with it , you find that there are many types of play that the brain is wired , but there are predictable patterns , and these patterns are the risk factors that one of those disorders evolve . 
what we need is a new generation of heroes . especially those of us who live in the united states today of america , but also the rest of the world has got to understand that the story has given us a choice -- as jill bolte taylor found out how she could save her life , while she was through the amazing experience that she experienced , has been distracted . 
and i thought to myself , well , if this is a model of creation , if we make music that first lines the form of this context , and when we make art hanging on walls of art galleries and museums , and when we write programs that fits to existing operating systems , it &apos;s what &apos;s going on ? 
and the reality of society that we live in is that there are thousands and thousands of people out there who live their lives in the silent scream of despair , working in the long , hard hours in hassful jobs to buy things that they don &apos;t need to impress people that they don &apos;t like . 
then they particular for these works of race identities , and she told me , basically , the work on the right , obviously , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , of course , by a white artist , although in fact , the opposite of the case was bob colescott , african-american artist , leon golub , a white artist . 
it turns out that there is a sense of force in your own because people feel that these leaders were leaders at the tax , not because they like to guide others , not because they enjoyed being seen , they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought they were right . 
and the good thing about the perception of ultraviolet is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good or bad day to the sunbathing , because ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can kill us , and so i think we should all be able to perceive anything that is actually not possible . 
fifty percent break it down to 14th years of life , 75 percent by 24th year of life , a picture that is very different from the one that shows when you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , about diabetes , blood pressure -- most of the big diseases we know of as causality for disease and mortality . 
during that time , they do everything : go out and do research ethnographically , and find a need , come back to the studio , brainstorming and visualization of design , concepts that could work , and then they build in the most fun , build prototypes , find out whether they &apos;re going to work , and they &apos;re refining them . 
the particular kind of dragonflies that i want to talk about now is this one , because in most dragonflies , like the one i just showed you , the adult animal only stays for the short time , two months of life , does it not make a big jump . it can &apos;t be too far too far from it . 
and it &apos;s going to be suborbital . and the reason why it has to be sub-orbital is that there are no sufficient security solutions to fly with passengers in orbit . governments do that -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and yet four percent of the people who have left the atmosphere have died . 
so lula , he &apos;s full of problems , full of contradictions , but one of the things he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s driving an idea of how we can engage in international relations that are changing the balance away from classical north south dialogue to a whole new kind of global collaboration . 
samuel pisar , once the survivors of auschwitz , i said to quote , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in their most exhilarating moments , is still valid in comparison to the human , when he loses his moral orientation and frashes . &quot; 
i want you to take a guy who can sit with a woman who &apos;s enough , who can &apos;t hear it anymore , and his first reaction is not , &quot; i &apos;ve tilted out the washing machine , &quot; which is really listening -- because that &apos;s all , we need -- i &apos;m going to show you a guy who has accomplished a lot . 
and that &apos;s what we did , we traveled around , and we talked to the oldest , with the doctors , with the nurses , we had press conferences , we went out with soldiers , and we sat down with the isaf , and with the nato , we sat with the government of the united kingdom .
