us .
it really is .
and that &apos;s the end .
so that &apos;s one thing .
and we know that there are more .
well , here is the image .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
so here he is .
are you holding her ?
that &apos;s what we all need to do .
you know that , right ?
was@@ su@@ p .
you know , audi@@ ences like you , yeah , make the event .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot;
but that &apos;s not all .
i was like &quot; what ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot;
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
you , you can teach it .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
and that &apos;s what she does .
so , what do you think ?
that &apos;s a lot .
never have been .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
and this is happening here .
i don &apos;t think so .
and so this is what they do .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?
yes .
yeah .
yeah .
it &apos;s the cool@@ est stuff .
that &apos;s one city .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice .
all right , next .
don &apos;t ask .
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
i know it works .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
this much , right ?
but , yeah .
it &apos;s right here .
that &apos;s so true .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google .
now i know you don &apos;t think that .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
let &apos;s put it that way .
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
she &apos;s a high school student .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
that &apos;s a challenge . i like this .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer .
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
it &apos;s just wrong .
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
now , this is the very interesting part .
that looks like this .
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
this is what we are using . &quot;
yes , you know it .
so where do we go now ?
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s what we do .
ok .
okay .
here we have a problem .
people , you can all do that .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
i was like , &quot; yeah .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
that &apos;s very important .
i &apos;ve had some that could and wouldn &apos;t , and i &apos;ve had some that would and couldn &apos;t .
we need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e@@ . it could be i@@ . it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
now , she cho@@ se c , g , b , a , e .
here &apos;s another one .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
oh .
you know , we have to go through that .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was cra@@ p .
so those are the three a &apos;s .
what are you doing ?
and i think that &apos;s probably right .
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
and when they do , i &apos;m in the qu@@ eu@@ e .
and they tried everything they had .
and so i realized it was o@@ .@@ k. to go .
and that &apos;s what the song is asking .
can you see it ?
all right .
and i was part of that .
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
last .
thank you . all right .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ?
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paraly@@ zed by fear .
and the question he had is , &quot; can i do it ? can it be done ? &quot;
so i will do this .
so why is that ?
and to her , that spoke of a kind of atten@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess that she needed .
here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
that &apos;s all great , right ?
and that was what i did .
and this is after two years .
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
it felt like a revolution .
it &apos;s a custom@@ er , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s partici@@ p@@ ating .
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
but they were empty .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
thank you , thank you .
it looks a bit like this .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
but you know what ?
in fact , it &apos;s continu@@ ed to increase .
this is that ro@@ cket going up .
and he &apos;s on a mission .
and that &apos;s how i got out of high school .
so you can imagine how that works .
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
and he said , &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
which they do .
but it was not to be that simple .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die .
and i believe that . i believe that .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
you know the story .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neu@@ tra@@ l to talk .
politics and politicians will only succe@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
there &apos;s just one problem .
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not .
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right .
it was extraordinary .
i must ad@@ mit , i used to be one of them .
but , u@@ h-@@ oh , the kill@@ ers are within the cam@@ ps .
thanks .
thank you . thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
it &apos;s good for them . they make a lot of money .
and we knew we were right .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
i said , &quot; do you pra@@ y ? &quot;
it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
f@@ g : i don &apos;t know .
but people did not rel@@ ate to this .
so we percei@@ ve nothing as what it really is .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
no .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
thank you .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circu@@ it@@ ry does change .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re chri@@ sti@@ ans .
i &apos;m really sc@@ ared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
not the pain@@ ter , i don &apos;t want to think about the pain@@ ter .
i get to do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
what does that tell us ? &quot;
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
it was all these things .
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
and that makes sense .
and we all had all of that on ta@@ pes .
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no re@@ ference to jer@@ ry gar@@ ci@@ a .
and i thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
and if you can , just scri@@ b@@ ble a pattern .
he goes , &quot; sir , why don &apos;t you drive ? &quot;
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ?
i was seven .
and then we say , &quot; well how do we line them all up ? &quot;
really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . really , not very much .
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
it became part of me .
it &apos;s flo@@ wn around the world .
and then like kar@@ a@@ j@@ an . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ?
people are watching us all around , &quot; right ?
what do they look like ?
and it is really not su@@ ited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
yes , it &apos;s going to continue .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
there can be different ways doing this .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
it &apos;s too late . that is gone .
and he sig@@ ns off , &quot; thank you . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to brie@@ fly disc@@ uss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions under@@ way .
and suddenly , without reali@@ zing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
i believe a story there has to be told .
it &apos;s motion and emotion .
one in a hundred .
&quot; the sna@@ il . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , like the human@@ e society .
i was so proud .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in po@@ land .
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
right .
so here &apos;s a tumor .
it &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
they just don &apos;t like it .
so , look what they did .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i said , &quot; what am i going to say ?
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
so what can we do ?
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
and i dre@@ w it out for her .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
i said , &quot; what happened ? &quot;
p@@ m : so is this a good idea .
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
so , anyway , thank you so much for le@@ tting me speak .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just ritu@@ als that give us meaning . &quot;
and she says , &quot; they want to go . &quot; and i said , &quot; hon@@ ey , no they don &apos;t want to go . this is the middle pas@@ sage .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
the mira@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-@@ d@@ ressed .
it &apos;s a commercial example .
it &apos;s all about more , having more .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
but it was only the beginning .
ok , this is mo@@ unt ever@@ est .
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
and it &apos;s a real sh@@ ame . now why has this come about ?
and i found these maps which you see here .
that &apos;s exactly what people used to say to sue .
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
what &apos;s the goal ?
you see the idea ?
i &apos;ll show you what they look like .
what happened ?
and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
how do you do that ?
make it go away . make it go away . &quot;
is it that i write very well ?
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
and you all know what it is . you don &apos;t need to have a dis@@ ability to know that .
t@@ m : oh , 10 , 11 .
and it &apos;s not a diet .
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
our in@@ ability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot;
&quot; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot;
what are you eating ?
this is another species of work that i do .
and that &apos;s the sad part .
so , let me show you what happens .
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
and it turns out that we can measure that very pre@@ cis@@ ely .
and i believe there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
it &apos;s too late .
i go , &quot; why ? &quot;
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
ro@@ ger . i got &apos; em .
but let &apos;s play along .
all i have to do is hum@@ bly follow .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
it &apos;s more with less and less again .
but this is the source of innovation .
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally .
what about art ?
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
that &apos;s about that big .
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s pengu@@ in sh@@ it . &quot;
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
and we &apos;re getting there .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &apos;m saying .
this is when we &apos;re like , &quot; ok , we &apos;re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &quot;
what does that mean ?
you know i sat at home and i watched .
the sig@@ ns don &apos;t look good , some have said .
take out those who say they save too little .
do you hear it ?
we &apos;re using whatever le@@ verage we have to bring them to the table .
they &apos;re just not moving .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
this is not tri@@ vi@@ al .
they don &apos;t read music .
and the answer is no .
and she said , &quot; i learned something today .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one fla@@ p .
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
and the lat@@ est thing that i &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &apos;t know what it is yet .
you all recognize that one . this is the mo@@ st-@@ played tun@@ e in the world today .
and so he agre@@ ed .
and we cannot have all the answers .
now try and wra@@ p your head around that for a second .
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t .
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my wor@@ ries today is that we have many foun@@ da@@ tions now .
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
right ? good .
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else .
that &apos;s the change .
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
invest .
so let me explain how this works .
it &apos;s more than one device , you know , it &apos;s rene@@ w@@ able .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
because the world is big .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
and as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve dou@@ bled in size , you &apos;ll see them spli@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws .
they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
but i do that all the time .
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is fail@@ ing . &quot;
so i can say , with some certain@@ ty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
but we don &apos;t know where , since we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern .
so i moved on from there .
and then she cl@@ ari@@ fied . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it su@@ cks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
and the thing you really hope for is occasi@@ on@@ ally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see ton@@ ight . so .
we are only happy when things are in order .
obviously , i &apos;m having a fab@@ ul@@ ous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
and why would they do that ?
well , this looks like a picture of virtu@@ ally nothing .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
and this was 2007 .
and the ir@@ ony is that they don &apos;t need to be .
but i didn &apos;t find any .
but that &apos;s not really the question i &apos;m asking .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by su@@ zu@@ ki .
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s under@@ ground .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
that &apos;s the region where entrop@@ y is low .
i mean , they went to the ma@@ x for this woman .
and that &apos;s how this was done . it &apos;s actually sli@@ ce , sli@@ ce .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lin@@ ed up i guess .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cle@@ an@@ ing , buying things , sh@@ opp@@ ing , building . but they aren &apos;t here .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
we have liber@@ ia . we have con@@ go .
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
well , how many bot@@ tles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
they wouldn &apos;t experience re@@ stra@@ in@@ ts as we would . &quot;
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &apos;t been to .
the bri@@ de .
it is transpar@@ ent , made just for you .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen what that does .
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s sha@@ ping us .
that &apos;s the inter@@ -@@ mon@@ soon , the time when the mon@@ soon changes .
i feel that i have dig@@ ni@@ ty that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
went on , and eventually decided to de@@ vote myself , full time , to that .
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot;
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
but yes there are some solutions .
if you don &apos;t believe me , just ask sam .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
i really was moved .
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
we will fly where the me@@ than@@ e is .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
and i &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the under@@ dog , right ?
that &apos;s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
how did this happen ?
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
you can actually see , right here , it will vi@@ bra@@ te .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
so what do we need to do ?
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is lu@@ ck ?
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
that story perfectly cap@@ tures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
think about war .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
that &apos;s the responsibility of architec@@ ts .
n@@ m : not too fast .
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
i accept where we are .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
thank you .
we do it again .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on now .
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ strate of all there is .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
so then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot;
and i thought about a solution to this problem .
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
so we need to start getting better .
i was so wa@@ sted . &quot;
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
so this is the sig@@ nature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
he said , &quot; as a kid . &quot; he said , &quot; actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fire@@ man . &quot;
you all know the story , right .
so this is the foot@@ age that i was showing everybody .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
pretty much everybody else who does po@@ ll@@ s .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spre@@ ading .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
and it has to be free .
and one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you out here . &quot;
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
so here we go .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
everything except rand@@ om@@ ness . she did not believe in rand@@ om@@ ness .
and the ga@@ g is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
and what about sleep ?
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
come right over here , next to me .
so i was fil@@ ming .
it &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to ar@@ ise .
that &apos;s just one benefit of that .
it &apos;s that pyrami@@ d .
it will change the perception and opini@@ on of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
you can see the detail .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
and so a ham@@ mer , when we gra@@ b a ham@@ mer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grab@@ bing .
it &apos;s a very logi@@ cal plan , but it was not always like this .
and i thought , &quot; well , hey !
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
again , &quot; in@@ ward out . &quot;
and why are they so similar ?
let me show you what you could do right now .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of no@@ where .
r@@ w : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
they &apos;re all different .
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen .
thank you .
audience : ra@@ w .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast down@@ h@@ ill .
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
and i went to see the do@@ z@@ o .
those are very important , cri@@ tically important to us .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
that &apos;s two days ago .
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to become individuals and find their differences am@@ on@@ gst themselves .
it kill@@ s me . i &apos;m not kid@@ ding .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; pa@@ p@@ i , help . &quot;
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and just down the road , this is je@@ t .
it sounds something like this .
that &apos;s a potential scen@@ ari@@ o if we fail to take this seriously .
there &apos;s many of them up there .
but i know i needed to .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye .
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see dar@@ k@@ ness .
the future , as we know it , is very un@@ predic@@ table .
this is 198@@ 3 .
but the story is not about these chap@@ ters .
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ stam@@ ent to teaching and teachers .
but that moved me .
we were up in the mountains , 197@@ 6 .
and i think the whole thing ad@@ ds up much better if you do it like this .
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
it &apos;s been fantastic .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are said .
they want to make people live in fear .
so , yeah .
&quot; you &apos;ve been around for 3@@ 6 months , and this is it ? &quot;
so let &apos;s see what that looks like .
and that was really cool .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game exten@@ ds and continu@@ es even when you &apos;re gone .
i think po@@ p@@ cor@@ n could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot;
in fact , he was probably six in@@ ches t@@ aller than me , and she was about this t@@ all .
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horri@@ fic to think what we do to girls in the world .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
as humans , we are social , we are em@@ path@@ ic , and that &apos;s great .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
it is an easy answer .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
ok , any six of them .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
it says a lot about her pe@@ ers who ele@@ cted her .
so what i did is i took all of the intervie@@ ws where i saw wor@@ thin@@ ess , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i just heard .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has g@@ uns .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
now let &apos;s assu@@ me you go on ho@@ li@@ day .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
i &apos;m not conne@@ cting to them .
that &apos;s what you get fu@@ ri@@ ous about right ?
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
we want to eat , not be e@@ aten by , our food .
where is the queen ?
here it &apos;s &quot; c@@ and@@ y@@ city . &quot;
and they &apos;re not all bad .
these are major issues .
it &apos;s not only something that suppor@@ ts trees , but something that conne@@ cts people and countries together .
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there .
for those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poor@@ est and the most vulnerable individual , it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself .
what was actually killing us wasn &apos;t the musli@@ ms , wasn &apos;t the arab@@ s .
and i said , &quot; so , could you do it right here ? &quot;
i learned they are the sin@@ e@@ w which hold the force together .
no , i was quie@@ t . i was quie@@ t because i had not come for truth .
anyway , moving along .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
and this starts happening all the time .
perfectly nice thing to do .
well , then we get to this image .
and it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mu@@ te .
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opini@@ ons ; everyone &apos;s got an opini@@ on .
bo@@ one , i really , really appreci@@ ate you coming here , eng@@ aging in this conversation .
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
hands it back to me . and we do that again and again .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &apos;t make v@@ acc@@ ine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an out@@ put and a state in the middle .
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone .
so time , space , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , and then , most important , behavior .
but i think this is the fru@@ stration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &apos;re talking about .
okay , that &apos;s sever@@ in ha@@ cker .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
i re@@ jo@@ ice that it &apos;s still in my body .
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
what is the obje@@ ctive ?
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statisti@@ cian . &quot;
two -- and it was two of spa@@ des , right ?
now i &apos;m not a law@@ yer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot;
but it &apos;s all good in the grand sche@@ me of things .
and you see this post .
so what have we learned ?
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
great . cool . so i was really interested in quanti@@ ty .
the question was , where from ?
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
and you even find a church .
and i say , &quot; cate , what do you want to do ? &quot;
and they haven &apos;t collap@@ sed .
this is where we stand today .
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a produ@@ cer .
it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; is .
but the problem is , you get hun@@ gry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off .
you &apos;re too ke@@ en . you &apos;re too ke@@ en . no . hang on . hang on .
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a l@@ oud voice , it &apos;s too l@@ oud .
it was awful .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
my technology .
i travel@@ ed to iraq , afghanistan and liber@@ ia .
b@@ l : this is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
this i found , where nature had made a picture for me .
but still , we look at the pieces .
those cold , hard w@@ inter@@ s , i love it .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you .
so as far as popul@@ ar@@ ity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
and this is just an illu@@ stration .
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , steve . what a du@@ m@@ b idea .
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so den@@ se and so hot , light can &apos;t es@@ cape .
but it &apos;s also clear that pro@@ sper@@ ity goes beyond this .
it &apos;s really serious .
all right . mi@@ ke , thanks so much .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; ment@@ al@@ ese . &quot;
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham bu@@ tt problem .
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interven@@ tions .
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
and you interact a lot with your neighb@@ ors -- people you like , people you might not know .
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
what if god is in things ?
and i tell you stories from there .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
n thank you .
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object fig@@ ures .
number three : the hand@@ ou@@ ts you give are not your pres@@ entation .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
so i showed him .
now i know that seems lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
and these are the two concep@@ ts i &apos;d like to explore .
right ? a patient in the driver &apos;s seat , for example .
it &apos;s like , &quot; u@@ gh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
we have to change .
exactly . because i &apos;m not even tou@@ ching it .
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ir@@ eland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
it is about what we feed them .
here we see people that feel &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; n@@ au@@ se@@ ous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
they &apos;re even more sho@@ cked by what he says .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comm@@ ents , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground .
let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start ri@@ ding on s@@ co@@ ot@@ ers .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
but he was cre@@ di@@ ted with co@@ ining the phr@@ ase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot;
now , we have a ration@@ ale for that .
and no@@ ki@@ a as well .
that &apos;s when research fun@@ ctions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
i think that is wrong .
but i rec@@ ited a che@@ er . i rec@@ ited a che@@ er along with everybody else .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot;
but people live on this land .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative lea@@ p you can make .
and that was the language of the war .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
we can only make them , quote , &quot; pir@@ ates . &quot; and is that good ?
one is people need a guar@@ an@@ tee they won &apos;t be evi@@ cted .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
thank you . j@@ y : thank you .
she said she is &quot; sil@@ ly , nice and friend@@ ly . &quot;
and that was lar@@ gely because there weren &apos;t any .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more over@@ tly ero@@ tic .
now , it goes down to a. now to g@@ . and then to f .
the first embra@@ ce is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
the majority of people .
i believe in speci@@ fi@@ cs , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of story , and the past , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &apos;t do : don &apos;t hit ; don &apos;t bi@@ te ; don &apos;t swe@@ ar .
so , it was going no@@ where .
but the gene that regul@@ ates that down is broken .
i come back up , not for air .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
you must be out of your mind . &quot;
it &apos;s been a good ride .
of course , you got it wrong .
it &apos;s a very simple example .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
all of that is over .
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your be@@ ar@@ ings when you &apos;re in mi@@ da@@ ir .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
but because i had no family to in@@ qui@@ re about me , they could do anything to me .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discus@@ sing them .
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
my mother comes out , and he as@@ ks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fing@@ ered speech .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
this , all this bad news , is pre@@ vent@@ able .
ad@@ g : in per@@ su@@ ading them .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phr@@ ase : &quot; real world geome@@ try . &quot;
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
and i was so excited -- first person i &apos;d ever see outside of e@@ b@@ be@@ ts field .
and i think when you look at the animal king@@ dom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
you can qu@@ it i@@ .@@ m@@ . ; you can &apos;t hi@@ de your man@@ ager .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teen@@ a@@ gers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be lo@@ y@@ al to it .
why is this important ?
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
it &apos;s so un@@ interesting .
and it was his universe on pun@@ ch cards .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; far@@ go . &quot;
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &apos;ve got to get on with it .
but they have no in@@ cen@@ tive to do so .
now that &apos;s not quite true . there &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through swe@@ ating .
hi there . i &apos;m has@@ an . i &apos;m an artist .
this is the death star .
you see , it &apos;s not as dra@@ matic as the tsun@@ ami .
they &apos;re very little understood .
to be more accu@@ rate , i wanted to be a pop star .
and we are vulnerable .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them .
ren@@ der@@ ing auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity -- and the key@@ word is &quot; ren@@ der@@ ing . &quot;
governments are not changing it . why ?
what happens ?
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
and i can &apos;t have my pos@@ se laugh@@ in &apos; at me .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hur@@ ry . she &apos;s got food .
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
between australia and here , right , they &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rus@@ h towards the sun at night , and then rus@@ h back again ? i mean , it &apos;s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same conc@@ ern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transp@@ l@@ ant it here .
does anyone know ? ch@@ i ?
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal .
you can use it at ted .
and that gives me hope because people are not pur@@ ely sel@@ fish .
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets .
they &apos;re not a big deal for us .
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technologi@@ cal revolution .
this is what they think about my site ; it &apos;s ran@@ ked by blog auth@@ ority .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veter@@ ans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
the man , his name was ma@@ h@@ mou@@ d , and the child , whose name was ra@@ f@@ i , left .
and that &apos;s how we use the food l@@ ure in the hand , and we use food because we &apos;re dealing with ow@@ ners .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
and i &apos;m more of the , &quot; life &apos;s mess@@ y , clean it up , organi@@ ze it and put it into a ben@@ to box . &quot;
there has to be something better . &quot;
and , yeah , we can look back in retro@@ spe@@ ct and say , yeah , ha@@ -@@ ha , you know -- it &apos;s all micro@@ film . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot;
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
this was a critical mistake .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places we need to protect .
&quot; no , my daughter , she &apos;s coming in the bu@@ i@@ ck .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
and what &apos;d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the ham@@ p@@ tons .
what they remember is , of course , the great tri@@ um@@ ph , that the bri@@ ts were be@@ aten , and we won , and that the country was born .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
so prepar@@ e@@ dness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted aren &apos;t there .
but if they were together plan@@ ting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico -- the festi@@ v@@ als , the markets , the restaurants , the c@@ ant@@ in@@ as , the te@@ qu@@ il@@ a , the mar@@ i@@ ach@@ is , the ser@@ en@@ a@@ des , the pos@@ a@@ das , el gri@@ to , the day of the dead , san mi@@ gu@@ el , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be mexi@@ can -- doesn &apos;t disappe@@ ar from this world .
it would be great if the story ended there .
so , two months later , i went into ti@@ bet , and i started intervie@@ wing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t rever@@ se themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why i talk about us all going through this together .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ented this .
when you open up the front door , this is what you &apos;re looking at . it &apos;s pretty simple . it &apos;s a hole in the ground .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
and let me show you what happened .
the world i en@@ vision for her -- how do i want men to be acting and be@@ having ?
that &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
we &apos;re not doing films for the eli@@ te and the people in their glass houses .
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extin@@ ction .
then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
so , the house is no longer su@@ it@@ able for invasi@@ on .
bring it back up .
you know something ? this has been achie@@ ved in india .
the short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from japan .
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distin@@ ctive stage .
and now , 20@@ 12 .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
it &apos;s certainly what i learned when i was training .
&apos;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
life can &apos;t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
which i think is just fascinating .
&quot; u@@ h-@@ hu@@ h ... &quot; she said .
i believe in real life .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much rema@@ ins to be discovered .
and then you heard the original .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
actually , that was ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s answer too .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illu@@ strate .
so , how do you make education better ?
so , how far does e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty go ?
and i met juli@@ us the last week that i was living in ki@@ ber@@ a .
thanks , scot@@ t .
interest@@ ingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
and now all be@@ ts are off .
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agre@@ ed to get lied to .
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
i pulled them asi@@ de .
we don &apos;t really believe in c@@ ameras to do things in homes .
or just try this one on for size .
you know why ?
that &apos;s it without the case on .
in fact , you can see each lo@@ go is a little bit different .
every do@@ t is a person .
mil@@ o : i wonder how deep it is .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
along the way , you lost something .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spre@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and things at work , a word docum@@ ent , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
and that &apos;s clear@@ er now than it &apos;s been for decades .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
i realize that &apos;s an ambi@@ gu@@ ous stat@@ ement .
i kept thinking of be@@ ds and red che@@ e@@ ks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &apos;s thinking about ?
i didn &apos;t want them to be over@@ ly thre@@ at@@ ening or sc@@ ary .
the dolph@@ in &apos;s at the key@@ board .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
this was one of the biggest fac@@ tor@@ ies i &apos;ve ever seen .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
there is another thing with those tra@@ its that we so easily obser@@ ve in each other that i think is wor@@ th@@ while to consider , and that is that , in a very liter@@ al sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies .
and i thought , no , it &apos;s a very inti@@ mate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father .
that &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
but the pa@@ y-@@ off is really enormous .
imagine you &apos;re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a .
and if we can switch to sli@@ des -- all right , here we go .
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t cont@@ amin@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t pollu@@ ted .
and i swa@@ m through the night and i swa@@ m through the next day .
and why is it so difficult ini@@ tially ?
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot;
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , hu@@ h ?
what you see , if you see the ti@@ tle called &quot; p@@ m &apos;s car held . &quot;
no , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; it would destro@@ y me . &quot;
let &apos;s watch just another clip .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
can you imagine how small it is ?
that &apos;s what i get asked all the time .
but look what we just did today .
and sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke@@ -up call , doesn &apos;t it , to al@@ ert us to the fact that we &apos;re hur@@ rying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satis@@ fac@@ tion people have .
i would like to share with you this .
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question .
pretty clever , right ?
so what are belie@@ fs ?
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quie@@ t , scre@@ aming des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ press people they don &apos;t like .
i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . &quot;
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , ro@@ sie .
it was a way of lo@@ c@@ ating myself .
so again , the un@@ expected which is also the ra@@ w .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get hea@@ vier , and then we can take anything out .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
and he called the two of them to his office .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stran@@ ger , one requ@@ est : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
che@@ f : oh , you don &apos;t know ? let me tell you something .
as far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 3@@ 50 colle@@ ges around the world teaching video game cour@@ ses .
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flo@@ wers .
it &apos;s almost as if that stimul@@ us , you , you &apos;re not exer@@ ting influence on what happens as they navi@@ gate their daily lives .
we don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet .
where are you feeling this ?
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the a@@ is@@ le , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool .
and now the king co@@ br@@ a is a new one .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
and then it &apos;s time to do it again . last year .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
that was cool because then i had re@@ tail out@@ lets .
and she ser@@ ves it that way time and time again , and if you quar@@ re@@ l with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s oc@@ tober 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
it &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
so , there &apos;s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shou@@ ts , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot;
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet you know in your gut that it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
and yes , the red planet is red .
i just got this impres@@ sion that the money would work .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smo@@ king .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a proto@@ cell .
it &apos;s the most important map of all .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monit@@ or@@ ed by the culture .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
this just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
and then finally ...
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and fig@@ ures , and they say , &quot; i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
we put the citi@@ zen first , and not the c@@ ler@@ ks .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
i said , &quot; what happened to the lam@@ an@@ ites ? &quot;
and then , finally hits the floor .
so let me show you how this works .
you look at the patients , you can dri@@ ll in all the contro@@ ls , you can look at them , you can ask them .
you know , if they said , you know what ?
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
and , i mean , everybody in this room -- now , this is 3@@ 50 short years ago .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &quot;
ok , so that &apos;s the heal@@ ing one .
oh , after you stopped paying .
and of course , there &apos;s an ap@@ p for that .
it &apos;s sol@@ vable , not by being a demo@@ cr@@ at , not by being a republi@@ can .
it was the hon@@ ey in the water that made it swe@@ et , it was the oil that made it sick .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally commit@@ ted to being the heal@@ er of the world .
let me ask you a question .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us s@@ mile .
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
kt : no .
in the spin@@ al ward , that &apos;s normal .
and this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
i say , &quot; online organi@@ zing . &quot;
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
and the woman would have sex with it .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
i don &apos;t want them to be te@@ ased at school by the other students . &quot;
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &apos;s what writing is .
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con@@ dom .
and she came into town and she rus@@ hed around and she said , &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot;
he pro@@ ved it was prime with nothing more than a qu@@ ill , ink , paper and his mind .
so what do we make of all of this ?
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
it is about the state of the planet .
what does all this mean for economics ?
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of st@@ res@@ ses and a lot of problems to begin with .
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contribu@@ ting enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contribu@@ ting to land@@ fill .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my an@@ ger .
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they &apos;ve been ha@@ cked , and those that don &apos;t .
when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toi@@ let that doesn &apos;t fl@@ ush . &quot;
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are viol@@ ated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordin@@ ar@@ iness of it , is so de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing to one &apos;s sou@@ l that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
i pain@@ ted it directly on top of the man .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascin@@ ates me .
got a couple questions for you .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
audience : six . six .
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get conf@@ used and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay .
now i bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &apos;t even heard of , i &apos;m absolutely sure .
i want you to take a trip with me .
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
it was really hot . i was very hun@@ gry .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
&quot; you can call it a dinosau@@ r , but look at the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
often what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wa@@ ge .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
now this is a -- it &apos;s a little test i encoura@@ ge you to try out at a party .
all of these technologies we can use .
we are gr@@ ate@@ ful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to re@@ form .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a mo@@ dic@@ um of intelligence to that .
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i ment@@ or .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
so they take the first one that comes along , often .
and you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an as@@ sau@@ lt , the one in blue .
here &apos;s an example from that scre@@ ening study .
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of ble@@ ed between speech and writing .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the am@@ ish giving up cars .
it changed my life .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
that as we explore these str@@ ings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may un@@ cover a completely new class of life that , like bei@@ jer@@ in@@ ck , will fundament@@ ally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
and i said , &quot; i have no training as a doctor . i never cla@@ im@@ ed that . &quot;
not only is there a relationship between the eth@@ ics of science and the eth@@ ics of being a citi@@ zen in democracy , but there has been , histor@@ ically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the co@@ smo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
he was obs@@ essed .
this is the great lea@@ p forward , when china fell down .
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans ma@@ ting ? &quot;
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
let me demon@@ strate how it works .
and then i think the other point is that indi@@ ans today are far more comfortable with glob@@ alization .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
but no , for the pro@@ test , they d@@ ressed all in white , no ma@@ ke@@ up .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just gr@@ ant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
and what you can see is it &apos;s very non-@@ uni@@ form . you see a lot more structure there .
but i also learned very soon there@@ after that jes@@ us also said , and i &apos;m par@@ ap@@ hr@@ asing , the poor would always be with us .
and they could be extin@@ ct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pa@@ irs of people connected to each other .
clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
a government depen@@ dent upon the people alone .
very very hard .
so i &apos;ll just let you read .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures .
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads no@@ d@@ ding , people who say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot;
b@@ l : i &apos;m going to fa@@ st-@@ forward to the decision point because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swe@@ pt around the world .
it &apos;s really cold ; it &apos;s 24@@ ,000 feet .
in ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as they don &apos;t even ask . &quot;
except that they &apos;re not as rich as ours , because they don &apos;t have a cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex like we do .
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
the ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f people , they &apos;re no longer here .
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to have kids .
so , &quot; i saw many tra@@ ins and also ro@@ de on one .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
and fro@@ g mode .
the fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
i thought it was all graphi@@ cs -- so here it is in rever@@ se .
and this is a tea@@ po@@ t i designed for al@@ ess@@ i .
entrop@@ y means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of dec@@ line and deca@@ y , the ar@@ ch .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a wid@@ get like this . &quot;
and when you &apos;re told this , you feel kind of weird .
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the yo@@ unger kids .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappe@@ ar . &quot;
and that &apos;s what i do with my fur@@ ni@@ ture .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
and also tri@@ um@@ ph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
no big deal .
and that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
and that &apos;s how it popul@@ ates this map .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at sti@@ ck@@ y@@ bot .
if you &apos;re wired to make de@@ als , you make de@@ als .
and of course consider images that can be sensor@@ y patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or audi@@ tory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these se@@ als that are very , very tiny .
oh , wonderful .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
hell@@ a jon@@ geri@@ us is a person that is able to make a syn@@ thesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hil@@ ari@@ ous .
there is a side that fi@@ ghts , and there is a side that kee@@ ps the schools and the fac@@ tor@@ ies and the hospitals open .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up@@ -@@ swe@@ ep , like &quot; wo@@ op , wo@@ op , wo@@ op . &quot;
so if religion is not about belie@@ ving things , what is it about ?
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and che@@ aper .
if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a ra@@ pid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ decade or something more ?
but this is great fun for children .
fact is , there &apos;s a general rule : if you don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s fa@@ ke ; if you do like it , it &apos;s fau@@ x .
and this is on@@ going work , but der@@ mat@@ ologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a der@@ mat@@ ologist .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appe@@ ars that what i &apos;m stat@@ ing is true .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
i can see i &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here .
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hot@@ els , and i &apos;m not married . &quot;
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the hel@@ m , not because they enjo@@ yed direc@@ ting others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
this is a device that not only meas@@ ures car@@ di@@ a@@ c rhyth@@ m , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .
and one of them is called ta@@ ket@@ a . which is which ?
what could they learn to do ?
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in sho@@ ck .
we need to use less to make more .
and you &apos;ll see there is a line , a fa@@ int line going across that image .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
this is a kind of op@@ tical deal , right ?
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
the culture in which we live now is a@@ was@@ h with music of impro@@ vis@@ ation that &apos;s been sli@@ ced , di@@ ced , la@@ y@@ ered and , god knows , distribu@@ ted and sold .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scen@@ es .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s ra@@ cked with fam@@ ine and dr@@ ought .
sor@@ row , an@@ ger , m@@ our@@ ning .
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the regi@@ ster@@ ed things in the e@@ .@@ u .
but how wrong it is .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that you are the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
you and your kids are fine .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
so it consi@@ sts of two parts , what we call an en@@ co@@ der and a trans@@ duc@@ er .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s the black box for wall street ? &quot;
you can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
and this is a mo@@ ck@@ up that is in s@@ alt la@@ ke city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in ful@@ l-@@ scale .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
i think that cro@@ ws can be trained to do other things .
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that c@@ lon@@ ing is possible , and that invol@@ ves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
how old it is ?
instead of invest@@ ing in a car , we invest in a community .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about t@@ ms .
in architecture , it works just the same .
and frank@@ ie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the need@@ le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
you see ban@@ ks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any bank@@ ers over here ; i apo@@ logi@@ ze in ad@@ v@@ ance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
and this is what the next piece is about .
those are things that are different for each m@@ .@@ s. patient .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
we expla@@ ined we would have number three ma@@ iled to them .
you &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wa@@ ste@@ ful .
and what &apos;s even more dist@@ ur@@ bing is what &apos;s happening with yo@@ unger boys .
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing .
what &apos;s your name ?
you see him all the time .
imagine you &apos;re driving in a fo@@ g . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avo@@ i@@ ding the accident , or getting into an accident .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divi@@ ded .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
and so i ended up walking like this .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
there are no pat@@ ents . anyone can make it .
wish i could .
the media has covered this some@@ what exten@@ si@@ vely .
with that , i have to ada@@ pt to something new .
so , this is what happened when p@@ n@@ as published this .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
and wikipedia has embra@@ ced this .
the only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fun@@ gu@@ s is actually inv@@ ading this tree .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
but the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
so if you look at the little scri@@ pt here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
they &apos;re ex@@ o@@ tic . they &apos;re experiment@@ al .
the problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and she@@ et@@ -@@ like at its dest@@ ination , but needs to be small for the journey .
but i had a lot of fun .
it does hurt . and we rein@@ force the story@@ line , right ?
el@@ on mus@@ k , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
and this man , arch@@ ie co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e , is a pris@@ on@@ er of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
you know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
the other part@@ ners that we have got is business communities .
he wrote this to his love , mau@@ d gon@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ il@@ ing the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
we hope to have that built this fall .
we were talking about the ra@@ p@@ ture ? it &apos;s coming .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
it per@@ si@@ sts for months and o@@ f@@ ten@@ times for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
it was a table as long as this car@@ pet and the h@@ arb@@ or com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er was here , and i was here , and my guys .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defen@@ ded heart .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bri@@ be a civil ser@@ v@@ ant , but you are allowed to bri@@ be a de@@ pu@@ ty .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invi@@ te you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
this was bad ! man , i was -- i c@@ ough . i was sick .
a few of these . this is a@@ ti@@ ll@@ a the hen .
this is the war@@ p and we@@ ft .
we actually think the future &apos;s going to be event@@ -@@ driven .
so when we have a robot which is surro@@ unded by neighb@@ ors -- and let &apos;s look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monit@@ or the separ@@ ation between them as they fly in forma@@ tion .
we must change everything .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
so the question is , how do you rein@@ vent something that has been around for five mil@@ len@@ nia ?
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preser@@ ve dar@@ k@@ ness .
d@@ l : so anyway , we &apos;re running out of time , so i &apos;ll just get to it .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
then it &apos;s : &quot; gu@@ ts . &quot;
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
this is the math under@@ lying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
can you imagine saying to your co@@ ach , &quot; u@@ h , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot;
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speak@@ ers in the last few days .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s the big ar@@ row -- and the pen@@ is on the right . the hand ho@@ vering .
you have to say , well , black@@ ness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that .
we were in the desert , in wa@@ di r@@ um , in a small je@@ ep .
animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
so , back to the public meeting .
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
i said , &quot; mr@@ s. al@@ isch , how are you ? &quot;
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deep@@ est secret that maybe millions of people are em@@ powered to help improve it .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fi@@ fe ac@@ cent .
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
tour@@ ist : i think that people are very fru@@ strated that they &apos;re not able to get closer to see what &apos;s going on .
and more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equ@@ ator .
so first you ask a big question : why we do it ? what is the goal ?
people come around us and start asking , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
and it &apos;s my feeling and it &apos;s my ur@@ ging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communic@@ ators of this , but also as the ones who carry that bur@@ den of carrying the children , be@@ aring the children , we hold most of the buying power in the hou@@ se@@ hold , is that it &apos;s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of ty@@ r@@ one and other scientists around the world .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clear@@ er .
and this influ@@ enced me .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
it can &apos;t afford to dou@@ bt the person who ten@@ ds the child .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexi@@ ble , inside yourself .
so i want you to rei@@ mag@@ ine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
the second , i believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
and la@@ stly , the only portra@@ it of a male that leon@@ ardo pain@@ ted , &quot; the musi@@ cian . &quot;
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex .
so how do i start all this ?
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the la@@ go@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
it requi@@ red that it was completely tri@@ vi@@ al : that it takes 30 seconds to reser@@ ve a car , go get it , drive it .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this pres@@ entation has been brought to you by target .
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
i think that the &quot; now ti@@ ed up , ti@@ ed down , mi@@ stress cru@@ el approach@@ es me , now ti@@ ed down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
the du@@ tch are good also , but the itali@@ ans are good .
and this ble@@ w his mind . literally . he che@@ cked into a san@@ it@@ ari@@ um .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jum@@ ping around and not foc@@ using on one top@@ ic . &quot;
each one is like a sun with a re@@ tin@@ ue of planets or@@ bit@@ ing around it .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
and what is the definition then ? &quot; the definition ?
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving back@@ ward towards me .
they want us to fit in even better .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappe@@ ars , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
this is work done by qu@@ enti@@ n lin@@ d@@ sey who &apos;s a graduate student .
and it &apos;s this combin@@ ation , this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive technology , that intri@@ gues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
i truly believe it &apos;s where dig@@ ni@@ ty starts .
we take out the things that aren &apos;t plasti@@ cs , such as the met@@ als they mis@@ sed , car@@ pe@@ ting , fo@@ am , ru@@ b@@ ber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ d@@ der here .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &apos;t really even find the bird .
they go out and point a telescop@@ e at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , esti@@ mate how far away they are , and p@@ lot them up .
one of the fo@@ under@@ s went to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , saw it imple@@ mented some@@ place , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &apos;t exist .
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound .
resol@@ u@@ tions , smo@@ ke .
so now you put the two things together .
so it &apos;s been a very optimi@@ stic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
and we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . thank you very much .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to re@@ fer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
i want to share all my love with you ...
i became the cap@@ tain of the team , and that was great .
and can you send me a bul@@ let ? &quot;
and that &apos;s the way i work now .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
didn &apos;t -- weren &apos;t you just terrible at school ?
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still dou@@ b@@ ts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
there &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of du@@ bi@@ ous value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
and they say to me , &quot; stop com@@ pla@@ ining . &quot;
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the she@@ ep flow and go where we wanted them to go .
when i li@@ ft the hea@@ p , i pe@@ ek .
ts : thank you , john .
but that &apos;s the only -- no , we were only photograph@@ ed twice .
even that wasn &apos;t enough .
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a law@@ yer .
if i could reve@@ al anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reve@@ al something that we &apos;ve for@@ gotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
you bring your water , you bring your so@@ ap , i was@@ h the clo@@ th@@ es for you . charge 50 pa@@ is@@ a , one ru@@ pe@@ e for you per lot , and a new business model can emer@@ ge .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
i am not making this up .
so what we &apos;re looking for is a perman@@ ent solution .
he had to issue a re@@ p@@ ly .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
what &apos;s more , they are able to walk up@@ right for long di@@ stances .
what about ath@@ ens ? medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t percei@@ ve comfort .
these are the di@@ stances of the tu@@ bes which make it walk that way .
my friend r@@ on@@ ald got@@ tes@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanze@@ es or other living creatures , is this sophisti@@ cated spo@@ ken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
she doesn &apos;t see the point .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridi@@ cul@@ ous names .
some of them are very easy .
instead , all the major thre@@ ats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
actually , that &apos;s a docum@@ ent@@ ary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge tra@@ de@@ mark viol@@ ation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
so , certainly the challenge was there .
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
it turned out , as i think you could see in ai@@ mee &apos;s cap@@ abilities and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adap@@ table .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by post@@ ul@@ ating an ag@@ ent that is even more complex , there@@ by simply com@@ po@@ unding the problem .
invest , invest , invest . &quot;
i would be a jer@@ k and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &apos;s central african re@@ public .
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad ap@@ ples .
this is probably the sky@@ line that most of you know about do@@ ha .
we are obs@@ essed with this way of thinking .
they set the pri@@ ces , and i don &apos;t even know .
but that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
is this really how econom@@ ies be@@ have ? &quot;
try to imagine a gor@@ ill@@ a per@@ forming the same man@@ eu@@ ver , and you can see that , compared with gor@@ ill@@ a , we are hal@@ f@@ way to being sha@@ ped like a fish .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villa@@ ges and go into cities , is because they are always gravi@@ tat@@ ing towards increas@@ ed choices and possibilities .
my work is -- it &apos;s a refle@@ ction of myself .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a mani@@ fest@@ ation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
there &apos;s no ice over it .
we feel so good about ourselves .
and he came up to me and he kno@@ cked .
look , the world has changed from anal@@ o@@ g to digital .
and when she got to the house she was gre@@ et@@ ed .
everything else is mand@@ ated .
and now the sh@@ ore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be on the wa@@ vel@@ ength of your audience .
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
and they are not the only one that makes the cros@@ sing .
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more cru@@ cial to our survival .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
so like fo@@ x mul@@ der on &quot; x-@@ fil@@ es , &quot; who wants to believe in u@@ fo@@ s ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
and that allows me to check my ti@@ mer dis@@ cre@@ tely , here , without ben@@ ding my el@@ bo@@ w .
we couldn &apos;t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , spr@@ ing@@ y legs , you could make it as man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able as any that &apos;s ever been built .
the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell here -- and if you fra@@ c@@ ture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
so we up@@ d@@ ated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
and so we tend to wor@@ ship ourselves .
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
it is a mobile ph@@ one-@@ sha@@ ped box that has an ir@@ on weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assem@@ ble this , right ?
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
and it was deep . it was deep in my sou@@ l .
you can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this key@@ board . &quot;
and anyway , to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said , &quot; you know , perhaps i could connect all your bran@@ ches and make you more efficient . &quot;
they think a pun@@ ish@@ ment is something na@@ sty .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
you could say , well , it doesn &apos;t look very different from when he started .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.@@ s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infin@@ itely more money glob@@ ally than we could just in australia . and that money fu@@ els research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so we &apos;re going to watch another film .
recor@@ ding : okay , here &apos;s something .
and he said , &quot; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &quot;
i had my own heart sc@@ are years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kid@@ ney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot;
i would be willing to bet that i &apos;m the du@@ m@@ best guy in the room because i couldn &apos;t get through school . i strug@@ gl@@ ed with school .
any society can adop@@ t these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achie@@ ved after 1@@ 500 -- only faster .
this is very exciting for those players .
i designed the process that gener@@ ated the form .
let me just say , look , my job is a privi@@ lege because we &apos;re in a special time .
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electr@@ onic control , and this is also with only four le@@ ds .
more than how a phenomenon works , theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
we &apos;re very used to this .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
how many of you did it by ro@@ tat@@ ing the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it mat@@ ched up with the one on the right ?
i guess you can only have one mira@@ cle per building .
and so we got to the gra@@ ve and made this , which was hil@@ ari@@ ous -- the attention that we got .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rock@@ ets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can es@@ cape .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we explo@@ it with our technology .
i think our tenden@@ cy is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
this is not just in he@@ bre@@ w , by the way .
ho@@ spi@@ ce was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &apos;t dying .
so we came up with these two rules .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; i un@@ lo@@ aded the dis@@ h@@ was@@ her , &quot; but he really li@@ stens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
even the b@@ b@@ c and the new york times .
we believe that the sta@@ kes are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even greater .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discus@@ sed carefully .
i need two people to help me out real quick .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-@@ tech green@@ house and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
so the key here is empathy .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
b@@ c : we enter the mar@@ ti@@ an atmosphere .
so i can see everything that ro@@ mo sees , and i get a robot &apos;@@ s-@@ e@@ ye@@ -@@ view of the world .
i couldn &apos;t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .
and nan@@ o was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
i think it &apos;s important to pro@@ mote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
it &apos;s really too bor@@ ing whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleas@@ ed with it all .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i &apos;m — i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the fe@@ yn@@ man bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the cro@@ ws coming back .
i said we can sh@@ orten the colum@@ n , we can spread it out to cover the cou@@ ch .
so when i do my job , people hate me .
the design of the body is a whole different thing .
so what can we do to think about bor@@ ders differently in this part of the world ?
so nothing is getting through .
but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as sever@@ e , which has the same orig@@ ins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gen@@ cy .
this is a view taken along the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge .
there &apos;s a fli@@ p side as well .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
you &apos;re a good person . you com@@ pla@@ in .
so that &apos;s what those great medi@@ tat@@ ors have been doing .
it is something to be great@@ ly optimi@@ stic about .
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a go@@ d@@ less person .
a culture which is top@@ -@@ down , ow@@ ned , where the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds of the millions have been lost .
now , about that co@@ w model i talked about .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
and what happened was we started creating these fan@@ cy c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
and the chinese said to me , &quot; dr. bar@@ nett , you &apos;re absolutely right .
so , that &apos;s a scen@@ ari@@ o that we think we should be capit@@ ali@@ zing on .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
we go on blind dat@@ es .
and i think that &apos;s a fundament@@ ally interesting question .
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach at a college of arts .
that &apos;s actually the actual prin@@ ter right now , and that &apos;s been prin@@ ting this kid@@ ney structure that you see here .
that actually occur@@ red this year . she took early reti@@ re@@ ment .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suff@@ ice to explain all of us and everything we see .
so i thank you for having the prop@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine the sha@@ ping of a new world with us together , and invi@@ te you into this journey with us .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
that &apos;s ban@@ ned now , and that &apos;ll be good news for the sharks .
and if we re@@ move the myster@@ y of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
don &apos;t give in to the wall .
but sometimes it just sat there .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; look , you &apos;re going to have to te@@ ar it down .
as you can see on this map , russi@@ a is still the largest country in the world .
but it all starts with see@@ ds in class@@ rooms , in my place , which looks like this .
and in ways both big and small , the narra@@ tive of the vic@@ tim shapes the way we see women .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , bes@@ i@@ des jobs , is electricity .
this pe@@ ers , in@@ c. concept is in a very difficult and complex real@@ m .
the age is 400 years .
i &apos;ll tell you how big the le@@ ver is : the le@@ ver is that big .
now that you &apos;re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .
they are 7@@ ,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
because the thing is , we are so ch@@ au@@ v@@ ini@@ stic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen .
these cor@@ als can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have sur@@ fing sc@@ ars to prove that .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
but i also don &apos;t understand how it does ru@@ in the magic .
so i &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathema@@ tically -- so bra@@ ce y@@ ourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which en@@ ables us to capture what is symme@@ try .
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; hon@@ ey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to mar@@ ry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; she was as@@ le@@ ep , because it was 3 a@@ .@@ m@@ . for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &quot; hon@@ ey , i can &apos;t tell you what this means . &quot;
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i ur@@ ge you to join me .
and this is he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .
so as a chem@@ ist , i wanted to say , &quot; hang on . what is going on here ?
it is fin@@ ite ; harmon@@ y is infin@@ ite .
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle .
why go from an a to an f or a b to a c ?
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with p@@ ure , consi@@ stent no@@ vel@@ ty .
and we define ourselves by our g@@ ap@@ s .
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
we so r@@ ar@@ ely look at the sky .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mes@@ h , because they don &apos;t have sp@@ ines .
then we like to take things apart .
but i believe it can be done in a way that prote@@ cts our priv@@ acy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &apos;t really know about you .
when you eat like a pri@@ mate , you can &apos;t afford both .
however , not one of you got out of your se@@ ats to think , &quot; right ! how can i cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
do you have a wal@@ let on you ? joe : i don &apos;t .
voice : don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
that &apos;s kind of ridi@@ cul@@ ous . it &apos;s a total de@@ co@@ y .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot;
and the purpose is not to walk in and constru@@ ct a home and live there .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simpli@@ city .
so the first one -- the most famous ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
and we were gr@@ ate@@ ful that i was able to get preg@@ nant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
and it &apos;s focus . nor@@ man je@@ wi@@ son said to me , &quot; i think it all has to do with foc@@ using yourself on one thing . &quot;
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down sta@@ irs .
can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no del@@ hi bel@@ ly in there anymore .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over@@ -@@ sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed lives .
of course , you and i know that co@@ ke is the better choice .
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essen@@ ce of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the under@@ lying reason that it &apos;s been poli@@ tically un@@ accep@@ table to talk about this .
and the man who talked at that ev@@ ening lec@@ ture was very interesting .
i find a lot of people have diffic@@ ul@@ ty doing that .
so he tried plan b .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do .
you see , the thing is o@@ bes@@ ity and di@@ et@@ -@@ related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , si@@ sters .
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
sur@@ ely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and for@@ give me , but in ra@@ w numbers these are very tiny acci@@ dents .
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a ru@@ t .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
without the sex part .
some of you might have seen this before .
we &apos;ve all heard these things .
see what the wars in r@@ wand@@ a .
p@@ m : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
that pul@@ ls in more material and pul@@ ls in more material .
na@@ ma@@ ste . sal@@ a@@ am .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sam@@ ple the oceans is ac@@ ou@@ stics , or sound waves .
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in green@@ land in winter , mars is still not very far .
the u.s. const@@ it@@ ution is the gay agenda .
for those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sensor@@ s and there are any dist@@ urban@@ ces , you know what happens .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play dru@@ ms on .
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids .
au@@ d@@ re l@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; the white fa@@ thers taught us to say , &apos; i think , therefore i am . &apos; &quot; she suggest@@ ed , &quot; i feel , therefore i am free . &quot;
another thing that information technology lets us do is start fig@@ uring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monit@@ or@@ ing , the amount we &apos;re actually using .
and she saw that if there is no in@@ fl@@ am@@ ma@@ tion then the scan is a uni@@ form gra@@ y .
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
the progra@@ mm@@ ers come and go .
can you feel their an@@ ger , their fear , their ra@@ ge at what has happened in their country ?
because , you see , dna is like a blu@@ e@@ print that tells living things what to make .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
we are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fa@@ thers , un@@ cles , cou@@ s@@ ins , all around us .
now in this reci@@ pe you also have the cost .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
what is fu@@ zz@@ y rop@@ e , you ask ?
how do you en@@ sure it gets to them and it impro@@ ves their lives ?
this is terrible , this oil -- it &apos;s in the water .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continu@@ ous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can be@@ have like a continu@@ ous flu@@ id .
in fact , we anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that star forma@@ tion shouldn &apos;t proce@@ ed in that environment .
don &apos;t be too ag@@ gressi@@ ve , it doesn &apos;t work .
where &apos;s art ? i got produ@@ c@@ tivity . i got spor@@ ts .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
now i &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
the key though in all of these , the red thre@@ ad , is the shift in min@@ d@@ set , moving away from a situation where we simply are pus@@ hing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead back@@ cast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ?
we were talking about , my friends in brazil , how we scale up this model in china and brazil .
&quot; and i felt so bad for this du@@ de that i took the l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop , and as soon as i did , you got this incredibly sever@@ e look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &apos; look at that . look at that .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a poten@@ tially contro@@ versi@@ al stat@@ ement .
because they thought that if you are having a telescop@@ e , you are an astronom@@ er so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescop@@ e .
meaning that you know you have no auth@@ ority to change anything .
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavi@@ oral tracking that i have not navi@@ g@@ ated to , but are following me .
so we &apos;re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of app@@ s they &apos;d like .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic we heard in the media .
now , the particular species of dra@@ gon@@ fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dra@@ gon@@ flies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far .
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment .
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &apos;m playing with -- when i first saw an ima@@ x film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there &apos;s a real res@@ on@@ ance between what i &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photograph@@ er . &quot;
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer .
the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an people , and many other arab@@ s who &apos;ve revol@@ ted and are in transition , have very high expec@@ tations of the government .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s mis@@ er@@ able because , you know , we &apos;re from russi@@ a .
and i want you to rele@@ ase that negative energy by sha@@ king it from side to side .
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of h@@ yp@@ e about our power to control biology .
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
sometimes they assu@@ me i am dea@@ f .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
so let me show you , and i &apos;m going to start with the standard method first .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
acade@@ mi@@ a says no .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analy@@ ze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ster makes this world , &quot; by le@@ wi@@ s hy@@ de .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
now i don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that ex@@ cess energy .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ or@@ a .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- docum@@ ents , data ?
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no fli@@ r@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fan@@ t@@ asy and , and , and .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic vo@@ y@@ age , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s super@@ massive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size .
and when there were com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about budget , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : refle@@ ctions . &quot;
this is called &quot; the cap@@ tain &apos;s hat story . &quot;
she was s@@ mil@@ ing . she did not understand why i was so worried .
but you notice , i &apos;ve che@@ ated , because i &apos;ve only gone up to &apos; 9@@ 4 .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
and then we have silk , th@@ ai silk .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost un@@ accep@@ table to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
in fact , she indi@@ cated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of recei@@ ving the gra@@ titude from the members of the exten@@ ded family , but she said , &quot; even god will s@@ mile , and when god s@@ miles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot;
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
you didn &apos;t break it . it &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
so thank you very much .
i was stru@@ ck immediately by the kin@@ dness and the gent@@ len@@ ess in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; on the cou@@ ch ; &quot; sit , &quot; tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ ru@@ b ; &quot; sit , &quot; look , i throw a ten@@ nis ball ; &quot; sit , &quot; say hell@@ o to that other dog .
not just because it ran@@ g earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because i made a little calcu@@ lation .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-@@ dimensional design , the ideas , the brand@@ ing , it all becomes deeply connected .
okay , i che@@ ated , it was a m@@ ere 20 seconds .
well on september 4@@ th , there was a huge m@@ op@@ -up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &quot;
this is the straight truth , the ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous truth .
we &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been off@@ ered to her , was her life .
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not sl@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
so what &apos;s going on ?
and they say , &quot; oh , yeah . const@@ ant acceler@@ ation .
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
and you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . there was no time to waste .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wra@@ pped up .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
only those three words and she left the air@@ port . that &apos;s it .
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
and the mother is el@@ der@@ ly .
when he a@@ im@@ ed , he never mis@@ sed .
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s contin@@ ually surprised to see you .
but what &apos;s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work out@@ put is of the type that can be easily shared digit@@ ally -- a picture , a music fi@@ le , software .
so if we start to think exponenti@@ ally , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
their stories were so horri@@ fic , and so min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an a@@ es@@ thetic ; it &apos;s really a truth .
but i decided to learn about the bi@@ ble and my her@@ it@@ age by actually di@@ ving in and trying to live it and immer@@ se myself in it .
so just to conclu@@ de , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
his father was an so@@ b , and , in fact , he was another com@@ edi@@ an with an un@@ happy childhood , but then we were off and running .
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spe@@ c buil@@ ders and it was tri@@ vi@@ alized so much that it wasn &apos;t ...
they send him to iraq .
when the mission was over , they actually land@@ ed on the thing .
so if i do something that hur@@ ts you , i feel that pain .
i &apos;m fascin@@ ated with the idea of what happens when you mer@@ ge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bul@@ b , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
that was it . that &apos;s all he saw as the op@@ tions . and not too far off .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve seen lots of dea@@ ths . how do they answer this question ?
i almost miss it .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loo@@ p with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
idea about women .
no need of sta@@ ying with me all the day pus@@ hing my wheel@@ chair . &quot;
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
i couldn &apos;t believe it , and i &apos;d go around dis@@ se@@ cting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
the person on the assem@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
and i wa@@ ited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
i believe , if ken@@ ne@@ dy was alive today , he would be asking statisti@@ cians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while .
i mean , what are the chan@@ ces that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
there &apos;s a point to be made here .
that is the power of organic design .
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
we went to africa , sud@@ an , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , liber@@ ia , kenya .
we used it at lo@@ yo@@ la on the cha@@ pel , and it didn &apos;t work .
so there &apos;s a lot more female gam@@ ers than people are really aware .
they were actually attac@@ king them .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these deb@@ ts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be car@@ ing about recently .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dra@@ g@@ ging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
they turned a chair from something the pur@@ ch@@ asing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real break@@ through .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electr@@ onic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long li@@ fes@@ pan , until we have the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bil@@ ing@@ ual enough to help us trans@@ late .
and he turned around . and then he divi@@ ded into six fig@@ ures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
on the wall is my book called &quot; super@@ natural , &quot; which allows me to remember what i &apos;ve done , because i forget .
s@@ her@@ man &apos;s up in shark hea@@ ven .
so what &apos;s going on ?
we said , &quot; could you build this ? &quot;
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ g@@ gling can be a lot of fun ; play with sk@@ ill and play with space , play with rhyth@@ m .
but they want to use it -- seriously .
but not wor@@ rying about r@@ ent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
and it turned out that most people wouldn &apos;t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &apos;d come back . and my dad had a third j@@ ar of p@@ ills .
he also expla@@ ined to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
it &apos;s that shape because the heli@@ um has to exp@@ and .
but really , really natural so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty was good for japan .
and she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
and then what happens ?
so i went to russi@@ a , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; so@@ vi@@ et union .
and so i had this t@@ .@@ v@@ . show .
so we can man@@ eu@@ ver this way .
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
i built the head . they built the body .
and then you have these millions of street lam@@ ps de@@ plo@@ yed around the world .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
so , practice compassion , read the char@@ ter , dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it and develop it within yourself .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
comm@@ ent@@ ator : there he is .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , se@@ arch@@ -@@ wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
we &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-@@ pit@@ ched t@@ ones .
i mean , can you imagine ? e@@ .@@ t@@ . &apos; s ph@@ oning home , and i &apos;m not , like , there ? you know , horri@@ ble !
and when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the ben@@ ch .
what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
you go in along the sh@@ ore , you can find it everywhere .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
yes , contr@@ ast .
there is no orche@@ str@@ a conduc@@ tor .
we need to spend more time appreci@@ ating what already exists , and less time ag@@ oni@@ zing over what else we can do .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell that &apos;s what happened ?
how do you discover the uni@@ qu@@ eness of a project as unique as a person ?
so what can we learn from all of this ?
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all be the same : like , the cha@@ irs you &apos;re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that &apos;s right next to this world .
so this is our last number , and we &apos;ll fe@@ ature n@@ at on piano .
and this exhi@@ bi@@ tion is about the work of designers that help us be more el@@ a@@ stic , and also of designers that really work on this el@@ a@@ sti@@ city as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clo@@ g@@ ging up a light so@@ cket .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
we can he@@ al the disease .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invest@@ ed here in africa ?
it didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
finally , i said , &quot; why am i cla@@ pping ? &quot;
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civili@@ zations that we look up to as having been p@@ inn@@ ac@@ les of human achie@@ vement -- whether it &apos;s china , gre@@ e@@ ce , the hin@@ du civilization , or the may@@ as , or eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans -- what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their everyday life .
so somebody says , &quot; d@@ ele@@ te it , please . d@@ ele@@ te it -- it &apos;s not not@@ able . &quot;
well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough don@@ or cy@@ cles .
you &apos;re afraid if you look for your passion and don &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re an i@@ di@@ ot , so then you make exc@@ uses about why you &apos;re not going to look for your passion .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
and when i was appl@@ ying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my a@@ unt who survi@@ ved years of be@@ at@@ ings at the hand of her husband and es@@ cap@@ ed a marriage of ab@@ use with only her dig@@ ni@@ ty in@@ t@@ act .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robo@@ tics competi@@ tions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
and i started to bring some order into some fla@@ gs .
so if you don &apos;t know one of these languages , it &apos;s inst@@ ant learning .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cab@@ in@@ et .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , obser@@ ving every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then plac@@ ing that within this .
these young boys are in ne@@ p@@ al .
and interest@@ ingly , from an identity stand@@ point , what does it mean to have a dis@@ ability ?
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &apos;s easy to become se@@ duced by them .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
it &apos;s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &apos;s the only way to rele@@ ase the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw g@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ ho@@ er@@ u .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
so we started giving back .
&quot; we don &apos;t care about being happy . we need to live with passion .
he would tell you , &quot; i &apos;m a colle@@ ctor , and i cu@@ rate a museum . &quot;
if you don &apos;t want to be dec@@ ei@@ ved , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hun@@ gry for ?
thinking it through , i realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move t to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
and then she made me go up with the ta@@ pe of it and prove that george ab@@ bot@@ t actually could talk .
and of course , by the time you get to the average work@@ place , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-@@ it notes . it &apos;s pretty bar@@ ren .
a handy thing to have , because language is infin@@ ite , and you can &apos;t just par@@ rot back the sent@@ ences that you &apos;ve heard .
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; o@@ ops , du@@ mp@@ ster . &quot; &quot; o@@ ops &quot; this . &quot; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &quot;
and if you look north here , there &apos;s a big river that flo@@ ws into the la@@ ke that &apos;s been carrying se@@ di@@ ment and preser@@ ving the rema@@ ins of the animals that lived there .
well , we collect data from satelli@@ tes , from air@@ planes , from ground vehi@@ cles , from people .
and he looked intri@@ gu@@ ed despite himself , and he said , &quot; okay , go on . &quot;
but look at all the electro@@ des around it .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the she@@ ep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingre@@ di@@ ents in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
so if it &apos;s a cell or a ter@@ mi@@ te or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
reach@@ ing success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
you see , the indi@@ ans also had a river that separ@@ ates the land of the living from the land of the dead .
and what &apos;s interesting is that it was just 199@@ 0 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
so these are my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping on this pe@@ d@@ al right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ham@@ bone sol@@ o or something like this .
or you can go back and change the hei@@ ght . now , sk@@ ill .
this is called &quot; thir@@ st . &quot;
so she &apos;s even more glam@@ or@@ ous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more or@@ ph@@ ans .
so we said , &quot; okay , give us a reward and give us a pun@@ ish@@ ment . okay ? &quot;
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they stri@@ ke this funny little position that says , &quot; i &apos;m not thre@@ at@@ ening , but i need a mas@@ sage . &quot;
it &apos;s just un@@ belie@@ vable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like hea@@ ven .
it &apos;s not a pri@@ ority . &quot;
they thought this was fundamental .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag@@ in@@ as .
it &apos;s kind of ne@@ at . what a wonderful design .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of par@@ ad@@ ise was re@@ ga@@ ined . &quot;
so , &quot; related sear@@ ches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this fe@@ ature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &quot; related sear@@ ches . &quot;
and one day , we went for a meeting .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 4@@ 1 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of her@@ s , if it doesn &apos;t ble@@ ed when you cut it , my da@@ d@@ dy doesn &apos;t understand it .
that &apos;s not dir@@ ty enough . let &apos;s just sti@@ r that up a little bit .
the threat is serious , and the time to pre@@ p@@ are for it is now .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems we &apos;ve in@@ fli@@ cted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
you know , we &apos;re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
whi@@ che@@ ver way they want to do it , of their own vo@@ li@@ tion , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new ze@@ al@@ and .
it didn &apos;t work .
and all we &apos;ve got is a ro@@ om@@ ba .
they &apos;re smaller , even less rever@@ ber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ l@@ ly music that &apos;s very intri@@ cate -- and it works .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we pre@@ p@@ are too much , we think too much .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of whe@@ at , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 st@@ ages .
from the fact that they are only ser@@ ving one audience , main@@ ly the western culture .
and we had an increase in income .
another benefit of wi@@ -@@ f@@ i , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi@@ -@@ f@@ i .
here we go .
and then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the com@@ mu@@ te .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that j@@ as@@ on has illu@@ strated .
people really can learn a language with it .
this is a laun@@ dry ch@@ ute , and this right here is a sho@@ e last .
ts : those are perman@@ ent magne@@ ts , yeah .
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , enga@@ ged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pu@@ ber@@ ty , or whatever it is .
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
you all know that . at the last i@@ p@@ c@@ c sum@@ mary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; how certain are you ? &quot; they wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
though in all seri@@ ousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
it &apos;s just a colle@@ ction of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
now why is that top problem so easy and the bottom problem so hard ?
and we &apos;re actually cam@@ bo@@ di@@ ans .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
and that will have led to speci@@ alization .
god bl@@ ess .
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divi@@ ded into two cam@@ ps .
there is one more decision .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and m@@ our@@ ning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
so let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
that sounds like a w@@ inner ; we &apos;ll go with it . &quot;
and if you go on the diag@@ onal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
and how can we do that ?
there are very few doctors and , quite frank@@ ly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cop@@ e with such epide@@ mi@@ cs .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ able in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &apos;m really hop@@ ing that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bac@@ chan@@ al by ti@@ ti@@ an . &quot;
s@@ b : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a sc@@ ore@@ board li@@ ft .
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relev@@ ance to humans that we really need to , even from a sel@@ fish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible .
that &apos;s the pan@@ the@@ on next to it .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
and so we spent time travel@@ ing with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were pl@@ ent@@ y of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies that weren &apos;t being capit@@ alized on .
other examples you can see here are from lat@@ via , li@@ th@@ u@@ ania , est@@ on@@ ia -- the central european countries .
and so in 199@@ 7 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together .
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was dis@@ char@@ ged from that hospital , and i jo@@ ined a group of surge@@ ons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
they see us as ro@@ cking the boat , and you can understand why .
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , sec@@ ure , healthy and dur@@ able .
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
many of these dea@@ ths were completely pre@@ vent@@ able , and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
and i looked at it bene@@ ath the microscop@@ e . and some of it was flat .
these are the classi@@ c conditions that create re@@ gre@@ t .
we &apos;ve never seen anything even re@@ mot@@ ely like this before . &quot;
i brought it here .
it causes them to di@@ stor@@ t reality .
what does that mean for us in the west ?
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
it &apos;s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
but it was really bru@@ tal .
the electricity is free .
and here is this , then , young man called wil@@ ly bo@@ h@@ m who worked for the us@@ aid .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
this is about my friend brenn@@ an .
so your house is dealing with lea@@ ks all the time , but it &apos;s fix@@ ing them . it &apos;s dra@@ ining them out and so on .
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha .
you can see , for example , that the achie@@ vement sc@@ ore almost dou@@ bles in this particular experiment .
it &apos;s so un@@ comfortable .
you can continue to inno@@ v@@ ate and inv@@ ent .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
hon@@ est@@ ly , better or worse ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
let &apos;s start with business .
and if anybody as@@ ks why you &apos;re carrying a con@@ dom , you can just say you like the design .
but when i lec@@ ture to environ@@ ment@@ all@@ y-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and was@@ hing machines . &quot;
so what are they ?
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dis@@ section .
but it is difficult to hear the words al@@ oud .
but you need to look at context .
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &apos;s not a fair compar@@ ison to make , given that we know that we are not ro@@ dents .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at the gro@@ und@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my fir@@ m , have ever been involved in .
my dad said , &quot; that &apos;s one , &quot; and i still didn &apos;t let that go .
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that fru@@ strate you when you try to s@@ w@@ at the fly .
this next decade is the decade of games .
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these dis@@ orders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there &apos;s a lot of vari@@ ation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predic@@ table patterns , and those patterns are risk fac@@ tors for developing one of these dis@@ orders .
by now , we have now cra@@ w@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew it , i knew it .
it comes back to instin@@ ct .
now how do we know about an environment that &apos;s so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we &apos;re used to ?
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tis@@ m out of the way .
thank you all of you .
it is always the same , never the same , end@@ less@@ ly fascinating .
make room for it .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
where does it come from ?
but what we lose , i think , is an accu@@ rate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context .
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
and this bone is pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed , as you can see , with the light sh@@ ining through the sk@@ ul@@ l with ca@@ vi@@ ties , the sin@@ uses , which warm and mo@@ i@@ sten the air we brea@@ the .
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of can@@ v@@ ases .
cham@@ pi@@ on sounds so goo@@ fy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
it &apos;s very powerful work .
and that &apos;s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
i mean , today , sing@@ apo@@ re is a first world country and ghana is not .
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very pro@@ sper@@ ous , and th@@ us use a lot of stuff .
we also see sharks , much more regul@@ arly than i would have expected to .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
as i say in my book , i &apos;m je@@ wish in the same way the o@@ live garden is itali@@ an .
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simpl@@ est form of life found .
we &apos;re now , instead of shi@@ pping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet .
it &apos;s the process of creation that kee@@ ps me sort of a bubble and a half above per@@ pe@@ tual an@@ x@@ iety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fil@@ ls my entire life .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is medi@@ ated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
now this is a little pu@@ mp with which you could inf@@ late a ballo@@ on .
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-@@ tech com@@ pos@@ ites our future will be made of .
were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this p@@ ace , over my whole career , maybe i &apos;m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a diffic@@ ul@@ ty conne@@ cting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
i cri@@ ed for a very long time .
these are some pictures vis@@ it@@ ors sent to me .
i &apos;d like to share a couple with you today .
this idea is ni@@ c@@ ely cap@@ tured by this quote : &quot; things without all reme@@ dy should be without reg@@ ard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
we tell ourselves stories .
but may i ?
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these inter@@ actions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the k@@ ings and que@@ ens of kenya or britain .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of y@@ ours .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of foc@@ using on loss or limit@@ ation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspe@@ c@@ tives .
you can t@@ we@@ et your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
the full videos are online if you are interested .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chron@@ ically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
so let &apos;s filter that out .
a lot has been said here about women , i don &apos;t need to repe@@ at it .
think of the financial world , for example .
prime numbers , g@@ aus@@ s , one of my favor@@ ites .
i remember we cri@@ ed prof@@ us@@ ely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genu@@ ine basis for optimis@@ m about the bottom billion , and that is the com@@ modi@@ ty bo@@ oms .
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it im@@ men@@ sely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
and to make them really stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical , let &apos;s make them both white guys .
this is a piece of property in br@@ ent@@ wood .
it cost 1.@@ 7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by ber@@ n@@ hard@@ t , usa .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
and now people from iran are talking to me .
this is a state diagra@@ m . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
he ta@@ sted it and fell in love with it .
let &apos;s take a look at it again . watch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
they bel@@ on@@ ged to boys .
so here is the earth . it &apos;s a little less than a milli@@ meter that was turned of soli@@ d bron@@ ze .
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaning@@ ful .
and i really loved this idea of the par@@ tial gli@@ mp@@ se into somebody &apos;s life .
then , after a few weeks , we set up cam@@ ps .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , specifically what that means .
he &apos;s dying .
and i was on the c@@ us@@ p of , sort of , ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , so i was starting to take bis@@ cu@@ its from the tin without asking .
is it all worked out ? no .
so , huge trage@@ dy .
can that be right ?
it felt like we were kind of la@@ ying these under@@ ground c@@ ables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come .
here &apos;s some numbers .
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
open your hand . thank you very much .
move your eyes around , blin@@ k , maybe close one eye .
he was a sou@@ ven@@ ir sal@@ es@@ man who always wanted to be a pain@@ ter , and i was frank@@ ie p@@ . tor@@ onto .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wer@@ y poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
will they move on ?
i &apos;ll give you some a@@ sto@@ unding things that have happened as we started this .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually conne@@ cting to all these people .
but the teachers came to me after@@ ward and told me they hadn &apos;t seen the kids that atten@@ tive .
the point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ mming side .
no matter where on earth you live .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynam@@ ics will continue the way they have .
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
and that means an increase in@@ cen@@ tive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world .
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
but remember , gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then deli@@ vered to me .
this institution is govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked and it has been the case for the past three decades .
i mean who would put themselves through that ?
so , this is an a@@ sto@@ unding table .
but if you &apos;re like me , my humanity is more like a window .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
it &apos;s achie@@ vable . we should do it econom@@ ically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organis@@ m and then appl@@ ying it .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
and so this is basically a song about lo@@ ops , but not the kind of lo@@ ops that i make up here .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
so i called the human@@ e society and i say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
one person w@@ ins .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens onto a sta@@ ir@@ case .
now she thinks the po@@ w@@ der is sugar .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
and here , this is a fl@@ y-@@ through the cloud of points of ti@@ k@@ al , and here you see it ren@@ dered and phot@@ o-@@ tex@@ tured with the photograph@@ y that we take of the site .
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar@@ co@@ s , the car@@ tel@@ es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the lat@@ ter are only provi@@ ding a service to the former .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flo@@ wers in a garden and then , basically , inde@@ x them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t .
and anything that you can do to pro@@ mote that would be fantastic .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goo@@ se wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
now , it was logi@@ sti@@ cally difficult .
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one machin@@ ed for myself .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pp@@ er . &quot;
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ pl@@ ying to one of those e@@ mails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
so we thought of an aug@@ mented reality app@@ lic@@ ation using a tab@@ let . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur@@ tured by the people around them .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
europe was not spar@@ ed either .
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teach@@ es you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . pri@@ ces of goods go up , inf@@ lation is affected .
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , r@@ na inter@@ ference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental compon@@ ent of how cells work .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years .
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
one person sent me a very deta@@ iled descri@@ ption ; the other person didn &apos;t .
the bad news is they &apos;re ro@@ cket fu@@ els .
there &apos;s the continent africa .
and she walked forward with such cal@@ m and such c@@ lar@@ ity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
it was incredibly successful .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front des@@ k and the guy at the front des@@ k said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor ton@@ ight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
and all i can really do is hope , not to poli@@ cy@@ makers or politicians , because as much as i &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &apos;t del@@ u@@ de myself .
they &apos;re also very obs@@ essed with status .
what will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this under@@ way seriously ?
it &apos;s a social aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness like you &apos;re a stran@@ ger in a foreign land .
it &apos;s one of many , many characteri@@ stics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
it &apos;s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between design , business and the world .
and we use all of them , even the tox@@ ic ones .
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the ci@@ vi@@ c square and how to really make use of this property .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
so , it can balance on a point .
&quot; my sister and i used to sing in cho@@ irs together constantly .
we &apos;re going to go on a di@@ ve to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lo@@ vely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ li@@ on wind@@ mil@@ ls .
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bom@@ b that was dro@@ pped at hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ satis@@ fied and incre@@ dul@@ ous when i attemp@@ t to explain consciousness .
thank you for being here .
and keep going , until the subject pres@@ ses the butt@@ on , saying , &quot; i see the change . &quot;
but , most importantly , while i was travel@@ ing , i taught children carto@@ oning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spon@@ tane@@ ous .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neu@@ tra@@ l place for ex@@ changes and discus@@ sions , and then en@@ ables you to change the world .
he knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this do@@ c , and i get your ct scan today and you &apos;ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your li@@ ver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot;
the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing is , i think , kind of the reason that behavi@@ oral economics is interesting and exciting .
we &apos;ve seen the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of small@@ po@@ x .
a cou@@ sin of mine died of aids , left an or@@ ph@@ an , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
and , you know , once a tox@@ in is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experi@@ en@@ cing our emotions inside , you know , an@@ ger or happiness .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses inv@@ ent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are emplo@@ yed giving them mas@@ sages .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sli@@ ced bread , no one wanted it .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
and as these dark clou@@ ds were cir@@ cl@@ ing me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
can of wh@@ up ass , the net@@ working force .
and within je@@ wish teach@@ ings , the rab@@ bin@@ ic teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
everything is not predic@@ table : the stock market is , at least for me , not predic@@ table , but most complicated negoti@@ ations are predic@@ table .
we love challenges , but when expec@@ tations are low , trust me , we will sin@@ k to them .
when i &apos;m on my de@@ ath@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
and all of it was coming from this : sh@@ ri@@ mp far@@ ms .
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that cro@@ ws are really , really intelligent .
so , i was able to stone one adul@@ ter@@ er .
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et prin@@ ts .
when other people see my tat@@ too , for the most part they like how it looks .
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian .
so first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ t@@ less dan@@ cing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur@@ turing your first few follo@@ wers as equ@@ als so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
you &apos;re live .
you &apos;re sitting on cha@@ irs .
i was born in new york city .
but that &apos;s true for adults too .
but how about the kid on the left , or the ath@@ le@@ te that leaves the field of play ?
leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psych@@ ic , ma@@ gical power@@ s that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the de@@ ce@@ ased .
if you &apos;ve ever seen an electr@@ on microscop@@ e picture , you &apos;ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asi@@ an person and a european person by looking at their ingre@@ di@@ ents list .
like if we had a piece of ta@@ pe now , we &apos;d pe@@ el it this way .
all we ask is , &quot; what ser@@ ves my interests ? &quot;
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autis@@ m gene@@ tics here .
and this is a rain@@ y ele@@ ction day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in ca@@ ir@@ o .
but here &apos;s the wei@@ r@@ dest place of all : war .
but the problem isn &apos;t pri@@ mar@@ ily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to con@@ gress .
and mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot;
i think you can really en@@ rich the way we brow@@ se our photographs and bring it to that kind of sho@@ e@@ box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
and , of course , we &apos;re not responsible for the consequences of what we &apos;re doing now , are we ? like all this com@@ pla@@ int about c@@ lon@@ es .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &apos;m full of dou@@ bt .
well , this is about state bud@@ gets .
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
i was born in al@@ geria .
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanze@@ es , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habit@@ ats .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , in@@ sur@@ ance companies , us , started accoun@@ ting for the power of that hope .
and again , when you can take kids from back@@ gro@@ unds as diver@@ se as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an ac@@ qui@@ red language .
but we feel like this could work in other places .
it did not happen over@@ night .
so i would encoura@@ ge you all to gra@@ b some pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , gra@@ b some s@@ alt , gra@@ b some sugar and start playing .
and then ab@@ original women in africa would come and say , &quot; this is it ! &quot;
mom , does the man just say , &apos; is now the time to take off my pants ? &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and myster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know .
he said , &quot; ok . i measu@@ red the hei@@ ght of a bri@@ ck .
they &apos;re related dist@@ antly to th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migra@@ tion , office .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and domin@@ ant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &apos;s la@@ id back .
and when we drop the ball@@ ast over@@ board we clim@@ b .
they are basically refer@@ ral services , essentially .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the pri@@ ce-@@ impro@@ vement cur@@ ve that -- we need some break@@ through@@ s in physics along the way , i &apos;ll gr@@ ant you that .
they got themselves ready .
h@@ c : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g ahead .
and when they did , they took small@@ po@@ x to 10 other countries and rei@@ gni@@ ted the epidemic .
and we gave the film over .
i also need al@@ co@@ hol and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
i want to talk about this .
see , mr. h@@ unter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok &apos;s village , and she was gone .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are cat@@ ching up .
not silicon .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator . &quot;
but since we ate all the o@@ y@@ sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a con@@ dom .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cy@@ ber weapons .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call &quot; pac@@ k@@ aging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
will you like all your children ? of course not .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affe@@ ction , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
in fact , so many different points of res@@ on@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t ta@@ sted the fru@@ it of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of mor@@ ality would we have ?
and i started across the hall in north car@@ ol@@ ina , because i thought it was probably a can@@ al@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in detail .
and we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
kat@@ r@@ ina showed us that we cannot completely dep@@ end on government to have read@@ iness in hand , to be capable of hand@@ ling things .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this che@@ mo@@ stat@@ ted ocean , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or ada@@ pt to this ra@@ pid aci@@ di@@ fication that &apos;s going on right now .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has pres@@ ented us with a choice -- just as j@@ ill &#91; bol@@ te &#93; ta@@ yl@@ or was fig@@ uring out how to save her life while she was di@@ stra@@ cted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
you &apos;ve seen people take bene@@ ficial technologi@@ cal advan@@ ces , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about ton@@ ight , and twi@@ st them into something cor@@ rup@@ ting .
when they &apos;re monit@@ or@@ ing your cli@@ ck@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time fig@@ uring out your age , your gender and your income .
as you can see , it &apos;s blo@@ cking her vision .
evolution &apos;s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bi@@ ble says , you know , god created all these species , cat@@ s are cat@@ s , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &apos;t change .
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai@@ ve .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modi@@ fy what i &apos;m saying to say , &quot; it will rain , &quot; or &quot; it &apos;s going to rain . &quot;
there was hollywood .
there is , in fact , another stage .
and we have a lot of sk@@ ill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that glass cei@@ ling ?
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
and the fire that bur@@ ned in me on day three through six of chem@@ o is the fire that is burning in the fore@@ sts of the world .
you &apos;re seeing an anima@@ tion that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this techni@@ que -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cen@@ ter@@ ed on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
if the l@@ h@@ c fin@@ ds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e@@ 8 theory .
we also need the choices for people .
and we have pl@@ ent@@ y of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &apos;s tri@@ cky , because as we put through all these tox@@ ic materials that we dis@@ gor@@ ge , we will never be able to re@@ cover that .
having expla@@ ined those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about tre@@ ating cancer .
i won &apos;t demon@@ strate pain behavior , but i can tell you i &apos;m not having any pa@@ ins right now .
we are progra@@ mm@@ ed for something called pro@@ creative success .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bom@@ b to end the whole thing , right ?
in swe@@ den we read it once and then we went part@@ ying .
s@@ b : par@@ don ?
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
it &apos;s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players glob@@ ally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
so what should we do about it ?
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves at a deep section , a chan@@ nel between us .
now , there are around a thousand tru@@ cks and bus@@ es and cars there .
well for the sa@@ ke of time , i want to focus on just three strategi@@ es .
they do all aspe@@ cts of the work .
because that co@@ s@@ mic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ?
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
the first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
so this is the foot@@ age he photograph@@ ed , and it was pretty moving and pretty a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing .
i showed a nor@@ man rock@@ well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
c@@ l : at this point , i &apos;ll take a few moments .
and what ba@@ yes &apos; rule says is that i should multi@@ p@@ ly the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the elli@@ p@@ ses , and that &apos;s my belief .
you see , i grew up in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
so , we deser@@ ve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
those kinds of forms ?
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
difficult , e@@ h ? it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? &quot;
all of us have dis@@ abilities in one form or another .
this is even a more interesting solution in se@@ ou@@ l , korea .
we are increasingly off@@ ered a diet in which sen@@ sation , not story , is king .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
so the contribu@@ tions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
so , we &apos;ve been conduc@@ ting a lot of research .
but still , now we have global warming .
and to re@@ mind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
the first number is three : three billion people .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappe@@ ared .
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
i was a young driver out on the high@@ way , and the car in front of me , i saw the bra@@ ke lights go on .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to k@@ yle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &quot; you know , maybe i should bring a cam@@ el .
so there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the clo@@ se@@ -up . and see if you can see it land .
i came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; we &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot;
it was min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing .
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
and so , in 2004 , they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed us to do a screen test of ben@@ jam@@ in .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
we are already l@@ ac@@ ed up as if we &apos;re in a fi@@ ber op@@ tic cor@@ set , if you like .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
so given that that &apos;s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a spon@@ sor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cr@@ ass version of our fo@@ unding story .
&quot; um , ab@@ ed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
the guy on the left is a safe bon@@ us .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us sec@@ ure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel sec@@ ure .
it doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
notice anything about it ?
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to re@@ build these boundar@@ ies .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
there &apos;s this large , con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated far@@ ming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 19@@ 80 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con@@ soli@@ dation , mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of small farmers in this country .
and the good thing about percei@@ ving ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to sun@@ ba@@ the , because ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to percei@@ ve things that we cannot percei@@ ve .
a me@@ me is not equivalent to an idea .
i &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of g@@ dp could never go down .
and i know what you &apos;re all thinking about are do@@ d@@ geb@@ all teams .
and i expla@@ ined , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a cro@@ w is per@@ ching on a bran@@ ch . &quot;
and there &apos;re only 10@@ 2 because people got bor@@ ed colle@@ cting them : there are just new ones every year .
we are limited with di@@ stances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those di@@ stances over time .
so it goes in and it sta@@ ys there .
it &apos;s a h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st of a different kind , and hi@@ ding under our des@@ ks isn &apos;t going to help .
hopefully , really understand the custom@@ er at its heart , where the custom@@ er is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
and i think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the v@@ ec@@ tor and increase the time .
maybe you &apos;re ti@@ cked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
and because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s en@@ co@@ ded for in the dna of this organis@@ m .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark do@@ t .
this is extremely practical , but not so a@@ wes@@ ome .
that is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
he went into a com@@ a .
i used the shi@@ pping contain@@ er and also the students helped us to make all the building fur@@ ni@@ ture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
so we grew up belie@@ ving no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lon@@ ely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their to@@ ol@@ shed .
there has never been a company that doesn &apos;t have competition .
so when i got this email from dr. gei@@ ger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ cian .
she is really the center of the health care system .
and then i swa@@ p it out with the students and actually re-@@ rele@@ ase that carbon black .
how many of you here love surpris@@ es ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
a new fron@@ tier has been found .
what you see in this top drawing is a sche@@ matic of how pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um gets used in the u.s. economy .
and yes , you also interact using natural gest@@ ures , both hands , etc .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a speci@@ alist in .
you get st@@ ressed , you do some medi@@ tation .
now you may not think of hot@@ mail as being mira@@ cul@@ ous , but for me it was mira@@ cul@@ ous , because i noticed , just as i was w@@ rest@@ ling with this problem , i was working in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa mostly at the time .
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about p@@ ts@@ d .
and stop with the lab@@ els , the limit@@ ing .
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
new@@ ton a@@ du@@ ak@@ a : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cin@@ em@@ a is for me , and where i &apos;m coming from in terms of cin@@ em@@ a .
she &apos;s highly ath@@ le@@ tic .
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge inten@@ tion and huge opportunity .
thanks very much .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
we need one today more than ever .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
and people who are teachers out here , who@@ ever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
so they sna@@ pped into action .
i &apos;ll get to you now the inci@@ dents of the day .
who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a co@@ w . nobody .
i would like to encoura@@ ge you to open your mind .
over time , those gas molecules dis@@ solve into your blood and tis@@ su@@ es and start to fill you up .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
it &apos;s time again to talk about &quot; in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth , &quot; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
this is considered the five bl@@ ess@@ ings .
i tell kids when they struggle through some u@@ ph@@ ill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignor@@ e the immedi@@ ate ob@@ stac@@ les and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ st@@ a around you gro@@ ws .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
i had never seen an internet .
i &apos;ve been ban@@ ging on about this like i can &apos;t believe .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
and they were probably pleas@@ ed to see you on top of the time po@@ ll .
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too co@@ dd@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to raise a generation of privi@@ le@@ ged ...
and i had to qu@@ it and come and do this thing called a better place .
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14@@ th-@@ century classroom .
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
i was leaving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot;
and , like ch@@ ie@@ f se@@ attle said , &quot; we did not sp@@ in the web of life .
you can walk away , you can just watch as this character stands there in the bl@@ ender and looks at you , or you can actually choose to interact with it .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goo@@ se@@ bu@@ mp@@ s on my body , because he said it over@@ looking the mo@@ ab mountains here in the background .
you cannot comm@@ and compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos;t we try a course of electro@@ sho@@ ck therapy ? &quot;
you read about it in your new@@ spa@@ pers .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ un@@ es , write it to a c@@ d , then ri@@ p the c@@ d to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
all of us , to some ex@@ tent , study this thing called a bill gates .
well , thank you . i mean , it &apos;s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
the active ingre@@ dient &apos;s res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , it &apos;s also found in red wine .
please , also on the bal@@ con@@ y .
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evol@@ ving and becoming extin@@ ct .
ma@@ ir@@ a kal@@ man : the illu@@ strated woman
so the first idea i had , ini@@ tially , was just to go the fe@@ der@@ al and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot;
this is a work , a library i designed for the ro@@ bin hood foundation .
i don &apos;t know where juli@@ an mor@@ row got that from .
now , so i know the frequ@@ ency .
if you listen to the way black you@@ th today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot;
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging econom@@ ies , we call them .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see am@@ i@@ d@@ st the fo@@ g the people immediately around us .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
and i organi@@ ze it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negoti@@ ation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s concep@@ tual world , the world of ideas , the world of as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions , of inven@@ tions , with the relationship of the ex@@ teri@@ or world and all the limit@@ ations , the na@@ y@@ sa@@ yers .
and i had the same reaction you did .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different min@@ d@@ set , a totally different society .
now , cor@@ n origin@@ ated , we think , in mexico .
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the earth .
ladies and gentle@@ men , i &apos;d like to end before time .
that &apos;s a person down there by the whe@@ el .
and at first , it &apos;s just a blu@@ r , but very quickly distin@@ ct things begin to appear in that blu@@ r .
i said , &quot; how many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , exc@@ ell@@ ent .
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
engineer : absolutely . intervie@@ wer : you thought , &quot; oh , bo@@ ther . &quot;
so you go to the liter@@ ature .
&quot; what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s a bran@@ ching off from the human form .
i think that really leads no@@ where .
one explan@@ ation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is un@@ likely .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its ac@@ compan@@ ying image , and how the image is trans@@ formed by the text and the text by the image .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death pen@@ al@@ ty law@@ yers have understood that the earlier you interven@@ e in a case , the greater the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood that you &apos;re going to save your cli@@ ent &apos;s life .
this is a bil@@ l@@ board that says : &quot; wel@@ come to the birth@@ place of general t@@ so . &quot;
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
that hor@@ n-@@ sha@@ ped region is what we call the swe@@ et spot .
now , there was one small catch .
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mon@@ es , that kind of thing .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they &apos;re all coming up red .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
so i &apos;m passionate about teaching these fl@@ s skills all over the world .
if you believe that i am my connec@@ tom@@ e , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connec@@ tom@@ e .
because you &apos;ve agre@@ ed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely diff@@ er .
it &apos;s very pain@@ ful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
that &apos;s why we must ada@@ pt .
and then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?
today , we &apos;ve worked with over 300 .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
because the off@@ ices are well equi@@ pped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
but i can taste things .
they &apos;re also fairly weal@@ thy and aff@@ lu@@ ent and all these other sorts of things .
right . i go to the del@@ i ; i &apos;m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
they &apos;re a bit sub@@ ver@@ sive in what they do .
how do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
and the same is true for the tro@@ ops .
because she fell in love with wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differ@@ enti@@ ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual mer@@ it to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as func@@ tional as we can and as fre@@ ely inter@@ connec@@ table as we can ?
and this open-@@ source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
and this one , look how it sli@@ des si@@ de@@ ways , every which way ?
w@@ k : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pu@@ mp water and ir@@ ri@@ gation for cro@@ ps .
now , what is the signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of these mirror neurons ?
it is very easy to fall in love with the de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized , bot@@ tom@@ -up structure of the internet .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur@@ ture the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al spirit and the tremendous un@@ ta@@ pped potential in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
they may have a lot of opini@@ ons about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terri@@ bly in@@ formed .
i will come to it later .
they are f@@ used together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
values are a certain kind of fact .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very soli@@ d , ste@@ ad@@ y , up@@ ward path , right from beginning to end .
and this noise is the most neu@@ tra@@ l .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right ballo@@ on team to build the ballo@@ on that would do this job .
so &quot; thank you &quot; feel li@@ kes a really tri@@ te word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
and this was colle@@ cted by an@@ ap@@ um -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will ev@@ apo@@ rate .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from na@@ than , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my leg@@ acy , part of my personal record ?
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price vari@@ ation .
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a , man .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
and often it does something more .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pan@@ de@@ mic flu .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being inter@@ rup@@ ted all day at the office ?
&quot; he was fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
all they have , really , is tra@@ de@@ mark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any gar@@ ment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a leader or rul@@ er or dic@@ tat@@ or .
in fact , when we &apos;re travel@@ ing ab@@ road , it &apos;s how we identify fellow can@@ adi@@ ans .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music rema@@ ins .
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &apos;ll make the kind of squ@@ ar@@ es that i described and maybe even get to some of those self-@@ assem@@ bled circu@@ its .
but , in fact , most boys tend to be a certain way , and most girls tend to be a certain way .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called e@@ ye@@ -@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
and it &apos;s a respon@@ sive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather .
the adop@@ tion process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , se@@ aled deal , an industri@@ ous , u@@ tili@@ t@@ arian solution : the government , the farmer , the adop@@ ting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the cro@@ p .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
if we can break down this sort of divi@@ de , this un@@ e@@ ase , this ten@@ sion , this sense that we &apos;re not fundament@@ ally collabor@@ ating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
b@@ p : i was born old .
this is the term that ar@@ mi@@ es use when they &apos;ve lost a battle .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &apos;s see if we can come up with some really clever in@@ centi@@ ves so that , even if the people we deal with don &apos;t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic in@@ centi@@ ves that will get people to do the right thing even out of p@@ ure sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &apos;s kind of much more interesting .
and also , what the anti@@ bodies use is a hand@@ le to essentially gra@@ b and neu@@ tr@@ alize the virus .
i &apos;m addi@@ cted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my gri@@ p on reality , i still cra@@ ve more .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , alle@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
i &apos;m like , &quot; get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
and for me china -- i started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and china truly is a question of sustain@@ ability in my mind , not to mention that china , as well , has a great effect on the industri@@ es that i grew up around .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
i walk around and encoura@@ ge them , &quot; come on , come on ! &quot; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
so there &apos;s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebra@@ te .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the ex@@ act same m@@ old that this one is .
the future states that there is no time other than the collap@@ sation of that sen@@ sation of the mirror of the memor@@ ies in which we are living .
it doesn &apos;t matter what kind of se@@ di@@ ment you &apos;re using to gr@@ ind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
but that &apos;s still not reason for us to dis@@ engage , because we &apos;ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
