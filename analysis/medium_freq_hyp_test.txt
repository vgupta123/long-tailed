they &apos;re offering to try . 
that &apos;s our average budget . 
so there &apos;s nothing going on . 
it was a tremendous success . 
that hope kept me alive . 
the spades king is . 
their voters are locally . 
i make my experience exponentially . 
some of them are very simple . 
this person doesn &apos;t exist today . 
thank you for your attention . 
lg : you like to happen . 
their children are playing instruments . 
this is what makes me crazy . 
south africa plays a role . 
thank you . 
but one day something happened . 
how true for lincoln . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
fake madness . 
hold on the node . 
unspeakably dangerous . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
behavioral markers are important . 
a coat hanger . 
you &apos;re hopeless . 
a new life was born . 
but now one last thing . 
totally changed by the people . 
thank you for your attention . 
this boy is called messoud . 
people didn &apos;t know about things . 
it has an extremely important function . 
there was no margarine . 
even that problem was too complicated . 
strong feelings can create a model . 
because we can &apos;t solve problems . 
nm : not too fast . 
you can use it at ted . 
uff ... mini-me . 
they would be numbers . 
it was overwhelming . 
because nobody really cares . 
schools are not allowed to be a bunker . 
but it was really brutal . 
1.6 million deaths worldwide . 
art is the highest target . 
thank you all . &quot; 
i had never seen a internet . 
because i &apos;m hiv-positive . 
this is five times the size . 
second , it goes from alone . 
in 2006 , it was a great year . 
momentum , it &apos;s built up . 
i &apos;m not sure of myself . 
but i can taste things . 
almost out of kindergarten . 
i just wanted a video camera . 
it &apos;s our invisible reality . 
you know very little about them . 
i was wrong with a lot of things . 
real dependence on this person . 
and something else happens a lot . 
the rules are confusing . 
i want to show you this photo . 
some conspirations are real . 
the net has two components . 
so we have to adapt . 
i &apos;m going to study at aims . 
don &apos;t give up the wall . 
there &apos;s also a flip side . 
this is a huge task . &quot; 
they had some speakers there . 
this is a collaboration at stanford . 
a man comes to the psychiatrist . 
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells . 
thank you for listening . 
every tip gives 37 . 
but i had a lot of fun . 
we took over the film . 
all of these technologies , we can use . 
but it &apos;s also true of adults . 
it goes straight to video games . 
that sounds completely silly . 
but people are living on this country . 
there are no quick solutions . 
this story started four years ago . 
he ended up in the car . 
feynman loved this story . 
i was inspired by a friend . 
he immediately understood what had happened . 
their metaphor is mobutu . 
these are my daughters . 
commentator : there he is . 
the next movement is called mobs . 
gradually , step by step . 
i gathered 26 children . 
i wish you a great conference . 
i &apos;m built for eternity . 
somebody needs to be on the front legs . 
it &apos;s a very powerful job . 
i love that formulation . 
they missed the imaging . 
i start with the business world . 
i fell down the face . 
so vulnerability is important . 
it &apos;s approaching the zero . 
i have some questions for you . 
i didn &apos;t think of that . 
here &apos;s another asteroid . 
here are some of the youngest pictures . 
you can send them an email . 
so he tried the plan b . 
these are abundant techniques . 
they would be below my level . 
there &apos;s another stage . 
now i have three different results . 
and then we get to this picture . 
we can see all kinds of faces . 
they &apos;re quite engaged . 
suddenly , we get to the possible . 
you don &apos;t always have to dissect . 
so the fishermen are starting more . 
it just amazed me . 
guns are not part of our life . 
they get so many things like this . 
so i had this tv show . 
it has 130 octants . 
be proud to have you . 
but i wish it would be better . 
it &apos;s a nice motivator . 
i think that &apos;s just fascinating . 
this is the current business model . 
but it bores me a little bit . 
for us , it meant freedom . 
they &apos;re farmers and factory workers . 
we did this in three steps . 
it &apos;s not covered with ice . 
let me ask you a question . 
dp : thank you very much . 
we have superstar banker . 
there &apos;s not enough photo . &quot; 
you and your kids are fine . 
unfortunately , the answer is yes . 
let &apos;s take a look at a clip . 
that gave me greater confidence . 
the classrooms don &apos;t have walls . 
there are a lot of different elements . 
the short answer to that is &quot; play . &quot; 
this is a 15-year-old boy . 
i was so drunk . &quot; 
we &apos;ve been believing in this for generations . 
they were together during the behavior . 
so i went from there . 
what made me more nervous . 
this is a building that i set in japan . 
now we have effective therapies . 
i was born in algeria . 
it goes back to the instincts . 
the date was february 2000 . 
i want to conclude with some quotes . 
but look at what we &apos;ve done today . 
the average is 65 percent . 
it &apos;s all made from very simple material . 
so i think that &apos;s too simple . 
every project , we make a film . 
and then finally , also electric vehicles . 
but then paul went into the water . 
it has no priority . &quot; 
but that &apos;s not how it &apos;s happening today . 
fg : i don &apos;t know . 
so nature has self-similar structures . 
there must be something better . &quot; 
i can &apos;t connect to them . 
&quot; he was smashed . 
we &apos;ve all heard about these things . 
she &apos;s about my friend brennan . 
this is him without crochetters . 
i think this is an interesting question . 
values are a kind of facts . 
i have a global vision as a vision . 
no matter where you live in the world . 
the earth moved for both . 
they &apos;ve lost something along the way . 
it was definitely a challenge . 
i love this gallianos . 
the machine itself would start the music . 
and i like that kind of reaction . 
let &apos;s talk first about biology . 
this is called &quot; thirst . &quot; 
then , of course , the answer is 99 percent . 
i was born in new york city . 
humanity is going to be describing that path . 
i ended up on every tv show . 
a print for 125 . 
but liberation is also money . 
they resolve themselves in months . 
it &apos;s about the state of the planet . 
and yet no one listened to them . 
it was a pretty successful evening . 
it raises up all kinds of questions . 
he had an answer to that . 
i could use it just by thinking . 
please , on the empore . 
first , she tried knitting . 
i &apos;m now 43 years old . 
the man is supposed to wait half an hour . 
i &apos;m going to show you how it works . 
and they have to reframe everything . 
this is a place called san francisco . 
it &apos;s part of our collective story . 
but you have to look at the context . 
the technological revolution opens the world . 
that can be an important contribution . 
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity . 
we have to make the right moral decision . 
bb : i was born old . 
we &apos;re just trying to improve our lives . 
and then i started skydiving . 
100 years ago , we didn &apos;t know . 
they &apos;re not a big deal for us . 
it &apos;s learning a lot from its mistakes . 
let &apos;s think about data for a moment . 
but it wasn &apos;t quite that easy . 
only one at the same time is possible . 
we don &apos;t do anything with these cells here . 
most of these cities are growing incredibly fast . 
this is an amazing chart . 
we have this database of things . 
my life would not be the same anymore . 
you read about it in your newspapers . 
and we define ourselves about these differences . 
there are these assistants everywhere . 
it didn &apos;t just happen a few times . 
we are obsessed with this thinking . 
we have to make this all available . &quot; 
this is how a hydrophical surface works . 
here &apos;s the biggest challenge for innovation . 
it doesn &apos;t give us any useful information . 
they reach awareness and self-sufficiency . 
they were removed from the gene pool . 
i &apos;m going to do that for you . 
they do all the aspects of the work . 
that was a logical problem . 
there is no conductor . 
and it makes it extremely dangerous . 
so we came up with these two rules . 
i have to point out here in something . 
now we put the two things together . 
i work with absolutely brilliant people . 
i found the word scaffolding great . 
but it &apos;s actually quite robust . 
here &apos;s an example from this study . 
we want to give you another piece . 
they simply couldn &apos;t go on like that . 
but of course , scientists couldn &apos;t help . 
i just couldn &apos;t teach them in it . 
it &apos;s about focus and presence . 
this is a video of the prototype . 
there are graphic designers there . really ? 
and yet , these files are there . 
the whole thing happened not from this morning . 
&quot; poor nations need aid . &quot; 
and the frog mode . 
so let &apos;s filter it out . 
so that &apos;s how much for political will . 
and europe was not saved either . 
the poll takes longer than a day . 
the nuclear bomb hits the stage . 
it &apos;s called the grandmother effect . 
but it &apos;s a great fun time for kids . 
and we &apos;re all vulnerable . 
the other application has a practical value . 
they probably mean something supernatural . 
fortunately , we were able to convince congress . 
the first gentleman is a baker . 
what we &apos;re talking about today is as complicated . 
so i have to make a lot of decisions . 
that &apos;s a lot of impact for 14 words . 
and something was napping to me since then . 
that would be bad for economies and cities . 
so i tried to measure . 
that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago . 
what i &apos;m going to show you today . 
it &apos;s not just about surviving . 
i didn &apos;t work very far back then . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve made of my life . 
only half the united states is taking part . 
it actually works like a big iphone . 
i &apos;m a designer and an educator . 
and let me show you what happened . 
so the seemingly impossible is possible . 
but they want to use it -- seriously . 
it was three days , four meals . 
and i talked about the availability . 
and the world &apos;s population will stop growing . 
he was operating and working in a factory . 
it &apos;s used as a symbol of transformator . 
you get something slightly more complicated . 
but it was a little boring . 
everybody : i &apos;m my connectome . 
that &apos;s more with less and less . 
we also like to take them apart . 
we also need choice for people . 
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence . 
that &apos;s just one of the benefits of it . 
it &apos;s good for students to motivate . 
half of them donated on the internet . 
that &apos;s another tribal leader . 
and the mother is already at the high age . 
here &apos;s a wonderful fractal . 
is all this work out there ? no . 
we need it today more than ever before . 
this is the power of organic design . 
so we turn to the literature . 
we can &apos;t have an answer to everything . 
the world needs an international forum . 
it &apos;s very exciting for the musicians . 
it &apos;s flown around the world . 
these little boys are in nepal . 
and this is how it builds the map . 
the survivors were one after another . 
i want to take you on a journey . 
here &apos;s candycity . 
i know a woman who can do that well . 
but we need to get architecture better . 
her baby will not be infected . &quot; 
you can actually learn a language with it . 
adg : to convince people . 
the next phase , she &apos;s achieved it . 
there is no country in the ocean at all . 
i &apos;m also talking about christianity . 
they &apos;re all mounted on my instrument . 
there were maybe six different colors . 
this is a multimedia tasker . 
but the mistake went in a good direction . 
we &apos;ve been working on over 300 now . 
the bush administration didn &apos;t even answer . 
why ? because they want our diamond . 
it &apos;s very much like a jet . 
it &apos;s a big challenge for the future . 
now let &apos;s take a look at another film . 
but nevertheless , we look at the parts . 
i am under the water with these fish . 
i always come back to the color . 
i reacted exactly the same way that they react . 
and that &apos;s led to specialization . 
that &apos;s our job as a cosmologist . 
contagious is a good word . 
i have a number of other inventions . 
chris bangle says great cars are art . 
they get the best out of both worlds . 
and we don &apos;t want to wait another hundred years . 
maybe they don &apos;t want to live the same way we do . 
the design of the body is a different story . 
and what comes out of that ? new life . 
get a job and get a goat . 
ts : these are permanent magnets . 
but i love you . you &apos;re not ? 
i painted it directly to the man . 
it &apos;s based on buying power parity . 
and a little kid in the back was like this . 
i want to show you a couple of these today . 
and then finally , it starts to recover and grow . 
i met a man -- the guy on the left . 
you can just make it right in the field . 
now it &apos;s a serious game . 
the foot is distributed throughout the leg . 
you want to hear it in different rooms . 
so it goes in there and it stays there . 
but i &apos;m not talking about that question . 
the larvae needs to evolve very quickly . 
sherman is in the haisky . 
now , this is the pantheon . 
and one day we went to a meeting . 
they go to eddy in lagos . 
i made a little computation to that . 
it branches off the human form . 
so this is our biological approach today . 
but they don &apos;t get us right through light . 
tumor cells can travel through the eaths . 
it &apos;s the heart of medical care . 
and we also sampled the outdoor air . 
&quot; let &apos;s read this letter to the letter . 
well , is there any alternatives ? 
and finally , the chinese were attacking . 
i fuse the dive . 
we &apos;ve focused our attention on the problems . 
tell me what &apos;s going on ! 
and then we &apos;re going to open more centers . 
and that &apos;s just a illustration . 
and the snapshot enters . 
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things . 
and sequel is really a real car . 
and this is hedy lamarr . 
and they sat on it for months . 
and you could put needles in them . 
so that &apos;s more or less what we expect . 
don &apos;t worry about the numbers . 
and again , this is not pure theoretical . 
i can &apos;t emphasize that at all . 
i come from burkina faso . 
they also form a third of our food . 
in 5,000 days , all these things have come . 
what if we look at fear differently ? 
and yet , we &apos;re talking a little bit about this . 
he was helping with a birth in parol . 
and we see this over and over and over again . 
we &apos;ve done a lot of research here . 
so these people will be part of the solution . 
one of them is the lack of buying power . 
and of course , there &apos;s an app to that . 
not ten horses , not a hundred man ... 
i said , &quot; that &apos;s kind of great . 
and not only do they cross the ocean . 
the technology here is the simple part . 
the bumblebee doesn &apos;t have to say that at all . 
our design is made for the language of a machine . 
china is symbolized by the dragons . 
the telephone doesn &apos;t have this delusion . 
now she &apos;s holding the powder for sugar . 
and there &apos;s locless apnoe . 
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret . 
what does that mean ? i have no idea . 
thomas batiuk : hello , eric ! 
it &apos;s a 50,000 components game . 
and the reason is , it &apos;s already been done . 
these are the next two lines in the movie . 
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot; 
that &apos;s an advantage of the older people . 
and now people from iran were talking to me . 
wires are &quot; pillow &quot; -- really . 
it &apos;s transparent and it &apos;s made for them . 
and that was not a misled feeling . 
and i was actually moving into something like this . 
it would change its everyday , right ? 
but you &apos;ve never seen this before . 
but nobody really showed it , right ? 
but there is also global warming . 
for example , think about the finance world . 
doubt and fear always fails . 
all the people around us look at us . &quot; 
most of these planets are candidates . 
look at the wars in rwanda . 
let &apos;s call them the killer apps . 
so what happens when this doesn &apos;t happen ? 
do you see where i &apos;m going to go ? 
in space flight , it didn &apos;t happen at all . 
i &apos;ll put him back in their hand . 
twenty percent of the population didn &apos;t want it . 
in this recipe , you also have the cost . 
skeptically , because you should question everything . 
all these work came out in the last 75 years . 
i took it out to the street . 
you look at him ! that &apos;s steve jobs . 
and he &apos;ll end them with &quot; thank you . &quot; 
and it gets up to one million people a day . 
it doesn &apos;t seem very good to work , isn &apos;t it ? 
and it &apos;s obviously going to make a lot of money . 
i can dissolve the skin of the lion . 
i had a pretty beautiful life in indiana . 
we all have disabilities in some form . 
now , how could we live without the only one ? 
the first number is three : three billion people . 
this is a site in brentwood . 
how long does it take to fill ih ? 
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for ipad . 
this is a man &apos;s bottom here at the wheel . 
it &apos;s scared , and it continues this model . 
so they let the light all over the house . 
the person on the left is a safe case . 
what are these lacks , you ask ? 
and it &apos;s terribly wobbling over there . 
we &apos;re talking about thousands of suppliers here . &quot; 
and there i saw this : lots of fish . 
all we get is roomba . 
this is the store during the tutoring . 
i write programs that fit to the world today . 
and most importantly , what causes these clusters ? 
and what do you see ? you &apos;re christians . 
&quot; do you want to try it , france ? &quot; 
and she said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned something today . 
in north korea , i created them myself . 
we started to research in other areas . 
and she said , &quot; just tell you about yourself . 
it was the first geese computer in the world . 
how should i ever know who the best is ? 
it &apos;s the five tensions . 
voice 2 : it &apos;s over with the neighborhood . 
it &apos;s completely loud and environmentally friendly . 
and i looked at them under the microscope . 
and that noise is the latest thing . 
it &apos;s also a moment of self-knowledge . 
the idea is called social impact bond . 
the dolphin is on the keyboard . 
i need information , and i need a container . 
this is the key word -- &quot; create . &quot; 
those without hearing are not here anymore . 
they &apos;re building their own markets and hospitals . 
but it also has opportunities and a lot of potential . 
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research and application . 
and people thought , &quot; you &apos;re right . 
in one year , it could be two more steps . 
that means our shelter has become a commodity . 
the impact of that is known and seen everywhere . 
i &apos;m the happiest man in the world . 
i thought , this is going to be my driver . 
it was the largest empire in the world . 
and half of all the civil wars are doing that . 
here &apos;s an example of solving puzzles . 
so i tried to win altitude again . 
and after einstein , this energy drives the universe . 
and it also comes to the essence of things . 
and now the cobra is a new symbol . 
somebody stands up and says , &quot; that &apos;s important . 
it &apos;s a bit scary , right ? 
so children are not empty vessels , right ? 
but it &apos;s not going to be possible in the future . 
i call the answer &quot; antique food lanes . &quot; 
this is what we see in this tippy language . 
you should always connect your life and your work together . 
so what do we do ? we keep connecting . 
but we all use them -- even the toxic ones . 
and let &apos;s say to tony , &quot; here we go . &quot; 
that then attracts more matter and so on . 
we moved towards michael and john whitney . 
let &apos;s compare the old world to the new world . 
is it really , how economists behave ? &quot; 
all of his colleagues said , &quot; that &apos;s unheard . 
david griffin : how photography connects us 
within three weeks , it &apos;s everywhere in the world . 
and the same pattern appeared in every conflict . 
we didn &apos;t see anything like this in africa . 
and i was thinking about a solution to the problem . 
that &apos;s the first thing we ever did in this field . 
efcharisto and calinichta . 
that &apos;s a different kind of work i do . 
and i want my music to be with you . &quot; 
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule . 
and parallel to my cut is my walking . 
europe had to be broken into economic development . 
we don &apos;t see the nuclear reactions in stars . 
so he came to me and knocked on . 
you wonder , what are they doing with this material ? 
my work is -- it reflects my brother . 
and that &apos;s what i do with my furniture . 
this is sort of an optical delusion , right ? 
how is it possible to do all this without the brain ? 
and he &apos;s a pretty smart guy , isn &apos;t he ? 
bc : we &apos;re entering the atmosphere of mars . 
mixed cultures . cultures increase income . 
in fact , that &apos;s an old hat for crows . 
no . there will continue to be paper dictionaries . 
they don &apos;t even ask in arkansas . &quot; 
two -- and that was the spades two , right ? 
so how do we run away where the galaxy is ? 
what happened when the pnas released that . 
did we talk about the disappointment ? it &apos;s coming . 
our school was &quot; bill nye the science guy . &quot; 
this is not just in the hebrew like this , by the way . 
this is a remote center at washington university . 
just fold up the wings and keep driving . 
the view was , &quot; here &apos;s the poor professor . 
maira kalman , the billboard woman . 
the u.s. constitution is the gay agenda . 
you know , when the children do homework at home ? 
but in history , it &apos;s not about that chapter . 
we put these beeters in the clinic . 
why is it so important that it &apos;s going fast ? 
and i &apos;m actually a bit of a visually impaired myself . 
there &apos;s a complete orchestra in the building . 
so you take a sheet and you put it to the side . 
and nothing we do is more important to our survival . 
and that &apos;s a shame . why is that ? 
and they can cost the ingredients at the school garden . 
just ask , &quot; does it serve my interest ? &quot; 
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity . 
it &apos;s called , &quot; the story of the capital cap . &quot; 
you know what ? it &apos;s done in india . 
look at the mental load and how it distracts . 
can you show us what a good pilot you are ? 
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about it . &quot; 
every city , every district of your own action . 
who are those characters who are so damn happy ? 
but what can you get upset about that , right ? 
how hard will it be to find life on mars ? 
we became social . the social network spread . 
here we have our star field . here are our shapes . 
and our joy in music , etc . , etc . &quot; 
everything had to be huge . the next picture was even bigger . 
in the united states and western europe , it &apos;s eight percent . 
he : you always see the last place i was in . 
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . just facts . 
these are the chains and the footprints . 
the next decade is the decade of games . 
it will be free , and it will work in every browser . 
i &apos;m a neuroscientist and i studied physics and medicine . 
that sounds like the big brings ; that &apos;s what we do . 
and the other one is called taketa . which one is ? 
and by turning off , it &apos;s more or less a zero . 
and these limbs , they form these mechanisms . 
once you have that , the calculation comes . 
in this case , we posted two chimpanzees next to each other . 
there was no cars , and that kind of thing seemed even better . 
and all of the reconciliations were happening , and so we did . 
if that can be melted , why not us ? 
i &apos;m going to tell you how big the force is , how big a force is . 
and then you enter the living room and so on . 
he used wild birds to create art for him . 
how do you ensure it enters you and enhances your life ? 
now , what happens ? what is a chance ? what is happiness ? 
the middle one on my kitchen table . no big difference . 
we create meaning through vision , through an act of visual poll . 
it &apos;s over 800 kilometers . of course , here &apos;s india . 
and i say , &quot; kate , what do you want to do ? &quot; 
i could just breathe very hard . i grabbed air . 
that &apos;s what i want to end up with . these are my older people . 
that &apos;s all &#91; unclear &#93; . thank you for that possibility . 
the consequence was studied by boltzmann in the 19th century . 
it &apos;s about their voter district , about their business . 
now i &apos;m going to run off my time . so i want to sing a song . 
&quot; this is what i want to look like . this is what i looked like before . &quot; 
and i read it , and it was -- it was just crap . 
look at me for a minute , and look at the whole thing . 
and now you want to introduce your music video . here &apos;s ok go . 
i know the answer to it already , but how do they land ? 
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world . 
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet . 
it was very hot . i was very hungry . 
i built the head . they made the body . 
very advanced , no air conditioning -- i &apos;m excited about it . 
and my question is , how did we get it this way ? 
it &apos;s not going to work . it &apos;s not a reception . 
there are different technologies . one of them is cell phones .

and then when he was there , we let him go , so he could feel the weightlessness actually feels like gravity . 
he flew it for the first time , he flew it to the second time , he flew it to the third time . 
so the first one is -- the most important appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour . 
but there &apos;s more good news later to come up with evolution , some sort of secondary evolutionary logic . 
it tastes great within the borders of the country , but it completely sucks if you take somewhere else . 
this argument , i think , is fascinating , as if we could bend the laws of physics a little bit so that they fit us into the game .

what was surprising was that , when we worked with economists to start valuing monkey data with economic methods , that they were fundamentally matching what people were doing in the right markets , not just qualitative , but also quantitatively . 
the key innovation is that , instead of our employees , what is the most relevant is we go out and count what you do , people out there on the web , for some reason -- proud , pleasure -- on the left , linked and attached to each other . we count and addict that . 
you might think this is the result of a laboratory trial , but this is the result of world-wheel , chaotic behavior -- countries accuse each other from the production subsidies , the local geese , insolves , marketing programs . 
and the idea is that wolfram alpha is able to figure out what kind of precise parts of code can do what &apos;s going on and then show examples of what can be chosen to make bigger and larger , more precise programs . 
the compost is then taken back completely to be deployed to the rooftops of the city where we have agriculture , because what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve lifted the soil of the city up to the height -- to rebuild the original landscape on the roofs of the buildings .

these populations have produced tons of miracles that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treated as a average , not as unique individuals . but ultimately , the patient is not the same as the population that &apos;s studied , which leads to guilt margins . 
the peak of that is that , if you &apos;ve seen your tadpole successfully , watching the procedures in behavior and development , you &apos;ll go out and introduce your tadpole to your namer and the signs you &apos;ve seen . 
okay , the good news about this is that the odds of being able to fly through this keyhole and hit us on his next round are one in a million -- very small odds . so i personally don &apos;t have any bumps that i worry about it . 
you know , if you hear these voices , all the small neurons gather together , and in that little hole , you get a really toxic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; chemical , and if you hear it over and over again and over again , you may have captured a depression . 
which meant , of course , everybody in the family had to be ready to drive them to the barrel area , you know , this peculiar blue note , fit to the turnsuit of polyester , you know , the same color as the buick . 
think about whether the system represented by china is not the one that , in the developing world , is becoming increasingly more and more likely to go into the system because they are increasingly convinced that through this system , their standard of living can be improved at the best and fastest . 
this allows you to step into performance by using this topic as a connection to science , because seti captures different disciplines , of course , biology and astronomy , but also geology , chemistry and other scientific disciplines can all be searching for e.t. 
now birds are pretty well programmed , most of them have in their dna , but in addition , they &apos;re promoted to use letters to show the young passenger pigeon the swarms , and how they find their old grounds and the foragers . 
the key is , even though you have just a couple of hours a month , these two hours of shoulder with a student , focused attention , that focuses on light on your work , on your thoughts and your self-expression , which is completely transforming because so many of the students have never had .

so this is a beautiful glitzerner , slowly turning thing , it looks something like this , and it &apos;s supposed to be brought to this beauty of the natural world in a very creative way so that each of us can calibrate its intuition in terms of space and time . 
and once you have mobility , you can produce a lot of motors because you need more units , as opposed to steam ships or large factories that aren &apos;t necessary for so many units , so this was the engine type of mass production , which didn &apos;t do all the other engines . 
the first picture i &apos;m going to talk about the beginning of the universe , about what i call the cosmic tatoring , which is to look at the remaining of the creation process to derive how he &apos;s played , and then to try and understand it . 
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object , but when you heat it , it flows to a drop of water , and you can see that it was really just made out of h2o , water . 
and if we &apos;re teaching listening in our schools , we can take away our listening from this dirt portion of these dangerous , scary world that i was talking about and bring it to a place where everyone is consciously listening -- or at least able to do it . 
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to form and change its opinion -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to , from all the futures to find and choose the most .

in the green areas , the yields of corn -- just as an example -- are very high , probably the highest ones you find in the world for this climate and this soil , but the brown areas are showing only 20 or 30 percent of what they should be doing . 
but instead of doing it through misdirection , and putting it in a different direction , i rather focus on frank , so on playing with frank in your head , your little wavman , and moving your attention from your external senses to the interior very quickly . 
in recent times , this power has been dissolved by jobs , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to get a significant percentage , if not the majority , human beings are going around with supercomputers , connected to speeds that are larger than what we now understand under broadband . 
as an adult , as i was talking about the amazing insights of penny goldson and koko , sue savage-rumbaugh with kanzi and panbanisha , irene pepperberg and alex , heard the pagei , i was thrilling for it . 
our communities , rural and urban , operate the operatives part of the infrastructure -- things like trash reproduction , energy needs , just as the social cost of unemployment , drug outrates , incarceration rates , and the consequences of various health costs . 
i &apos;m interested in how things work and what they &apos;re made of , but also because i think we should have a more understanding of the parts that our world is made of , and right now we don &apos;t know what the high-tech materalies are made of the future .

as an inspiration , the fact that all of us want to interact with other people is that all complicated functions i &apos;m going to leave out and i &apos;m going to get this sort of simplified object , a test , and show the early stages of new insights of what &apos;s happening in two brains while they &apos;re interacting at the same time . 
as a global philanthropy industry is created , and this is what is happening right now , you should see which aspirations there are to jettify these old conditions about the pile , so that philanthropy is open and large and fast and connected in the long run . 
collaborative consumption has evolved explosion -- web-based common use of cars , apartments and skills . rachel botsman explores the currency that systems like airbnb and taskrabbit work : trust , influence , and how she calls &quot; trusted capital . &quot; 
but we &apos;re not here at the point where you would have seen something here in your morning &apos;s way , which is really seamlessly the two-dimensional world that we &apos;re probably comfortable with the three-dimensional sky connecting to us in which i don &apos;t know how they are -- i don &apos;t really like to spend time . 
so , to lead a different metaphor , if you think of social networks as a kind of huge tissue of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you , and beyond the distance -- this tissue is actually like an old-fashioned american blanket , and it &apos;s freaking on it , happy and unhappy flickers . 
we were freaks -- hummer-hand boys and bold ladies , curiosities , who were juggling depression and loneliness , who were trying to spin on solitaire and bottle , trying to kiss and heal their own injury , but at night , as we were sleeping on the rope , we kept moving on the rope . 
this is called steling . it &apos;s a temperature behavior that we humans show at the crossing of the beach . we jump on a towel that belongs to someone -- &quot; excuse me , your towel , i know . &quot; -- and then you hook up to the next so you don &apos;t burn your feet . 
a congolese , who told me how her children had to watch her father kill and how she was raped in front of her eyes , and how her children saw her nine-year-old siblings being killed in front of her eyes , how they were able to do well today .

imagine a country that &apos;s rich in energy resources : oil and gas , sun , wind , but the most important living ement is missing water . infrastructural expert al-attiya talks about the extraordinary ways of getting small native state qatatatatatar to secure its water supply . 
so there we were , a nuclear physicist , an internistin , right after that , added up to carrie hruska , a biomedical engineer and two radiologists , trying to build up the established world of mammography , using a machine that was held by tape tape . 
and then i come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully i &apos;m going to convince you -- that i think in today &apos;s world it &apos;s really important for leaders , not just having an idea of what your company is important , but also having a passion for something that is meaningful . 
and today we &apos;ve probably got the most hive of all definitions , every case for me , and it &apos;s : doodling means legally bumming , droughts , waste time , make meaningless signs , do something of low value , salary or meaning , and -- my personal favorite -- nothing . 
and in this light , for religious people , compassion also brings us to the mystery -- to see us , it encourages us , not just beauty , but to look for god &apos;s antlitz at the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of a shiny religious absence . 
they &apos;ve been working on and through global products , and companies like microsoft , google , astrazeneca , general electric , philips have already proven that they have come from their bangalore- and hyderabo &amp; amp ; d centers to produce products and services all over the world . 
in the 20th century , we were witnessed by stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocide , and even though the 21st century is only seven years old , we were already witnessed the ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors in iraq . 
the third one would have been to let me show you a collection of texts that the 16-year-old girls have written , because i want to know how this language has changed since then , and in ideally , i would send it back to you and today so that we could study this language miracle that &apos;s played right in front of us . 
he takes a song called &quot; blind willie mctell , &quot; named after the flower singer , and the song is a journey through the past , through a much more dark time , but a simpler , a time where musicians like willie mctell have a few illusions of what they were doing . 
that &apos;s where you start to understand that you can get sick , you can poison . you have to balance your diet . if you look closely , and since then , i &apos;ve done everything i &apos;ve done with the recording of information , the generating information , looking at delivery of information from the way we look at food . 
the water -- it &apos;s probably one of the most severe problems we &apos;re faced with in this century , and everywhere the water is being polluted by agricultural , industrial and household feces that are still being applied around the world and distributed , seemingly unable to learn from the past experience . 
and in the slow second sentence , &quot; adagio religioso , &quot; he had built the sounds of a song that he had heard outside his window , prosperous that this was his last spring ring , and he proved a future for ditta in which he no longer played a role . 
and this is not just a short-term workforce to provide patients with basic food , it &apos;s the next generation of health care leaders who spent two , three , four years in hospitals &apos; rooms , and talked to patients about their most basic needs . 
so , if you prevented institutions , and you tell them that there are other ways of cooring that they show a behavior that looks like this with the purchase ross , the laughing of the reaction to the diagnosis of a balcal death : denial , tension , zorn , negotiating , acceptance . 
but i think research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment with david hume , adam smith , had actually a better understanding of who we are -- that the reason is often weak that our emotions are strong and our emotions are often trustworthy . 
what dr. soljacic found out was how to enable a distance between these spules in a transformator larger than the size of the transformators themselves , and all of this with the technology that gives you an opera singer that will break up a glass at the other end of a room , is not unsimilar . 
if we had evolved in a vacuum , we would expect it to bounce on the ground at the same time , if we were bacteria , all the way from the thermal movements of the molecules around , that would be different , but we &apos;re middle world leaders to feel the brownian movement . 
the x-ray technology , when it comes to large images of life , and besides these large scanning machines , has not enough evolved to provide an extensive quality of imagery and the resolution for what i want to do with this , which is to show my images at a large scale . 
interestingly , other neurologic diseases , which are showing completely different areas of the brain , also bundle false protein , which indicates that the approach may be a general , not only for alzheimer &apos;s disease , but also for other neurologic diseases , which might be applied . 
so if we can use the information that comes from this mirror reflection , we can start with a traditional facial can , which restores the kind of crude constructions of the face , and restore it through the thief information that refers all the pores structure and all the fine folds . 
it just takes a little bit of processing to convert that into a kind of digital fingerprint , and that &apos;s great when you &apos;re a professional user -- so a newspaper -- the tools are almost identical to the ones we &apos;ve just used in this demonstration . 
do you set up structures for this ? and you know , this is a personal relationship to expression , which is lacking in the technological circles , so we needed dan to do a new process of design , a new construction process to discover its movements , and his path to the expression that allows him to do that . 
and these animals are very likely to use , not just from the power and the energy that &apos;s stored in this particular spring , but also by the extreme properties of the currents mechanics , they could actually use the pulling mechanics as a second force to break up the snail . 
&quot; the human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , primal . &quot; in this talk , sopraniist claron mcfadden asks us to study the secrets of respiratory and singing as she talks about the demanding &quot; arie &quot; by john cage . 
and the gentleman said , &apos; you &apos;ve given your best , that &apos;s a success . &apos; &quot; this and it was the basis of my definition of success , which is , seeled peace , triggered out through the currency that you have beaten up to be the best possible . 
if we look at the many , many different species of animals , not just primates , but other mammals , birds , even thylacines like kangaroo and what bats include , there &apos;s a relationship between the length of a species and the size of their brains versus their bodies and how smart and flexible they are . 
in this case , rather than kaugummi or doritos or whatever they have in their pockets to throw in the fish -- there &apos;s a water body in iceland that i &apos;ve been looking at , which is in the middle of the city . the biggest pollutance load in it is not the street pollution , but rather white bread of people who feed fish and birds . 
so if wr wants to understand whether a planet is inhabitable , whether it &apos;s providing living conditions , we don &apos;t just want to know how much light he &apos;s getting off and how warm it is , but what the weather is surrounding it -- this energy radiation , the uv- and x-rays that go out from his star and make it into high-energy radiation . 
and i decided that the only way that was against that condition was a difficult dream , an extreme dream , needed to pursue the first persuasion and unprotective passion , something that would make me my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t reach him without that attitude and persuasion . 
it looks like a series of brakes of waves , winds , there &apos;s a snapshot here , and the winds above and under the cloud are very different . in the middle , between the winds , they &apos;re creating air vertebrae , and when the speed difference is right , the peaks of the cloud-waves turn turn around , and these beautiful waves that form unprecedented wires . 
i &apos;ve always attracted myself from these rare people that just strip and dedicate their lives to humanity with the determination of warrior and the mystician &apos;s gnade . people like martin luther king jr , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i should be , as long as you are not what you should be . 
then we &apos;re going to get a little more serious , so we have to involve our cad / cams and the engineers , or scientists who are familiar with thermal properties , who understand design , atmospheric interactions , parachutes and those kinds of things . they work as a team and develop , in a sense , on the computer , a spacecraft to see if it demands our assumptions . 
these drugs were being brought to the market . they were very often prescribed because heart attacks are very often occurring , and it took a long time for us to find that these medicines also lead to more die , and before we heard this warning signal , more than 100,000 people in america were unnecessary with prescription of medications against heart disease disorders . 
i had basically developed a very difficult thing to explain and complex philosophy that i &apos;m not going to go into , because it &apos;s a little bit too profound for you all -- but it &apos;s about what websites popular , you know , it &apos;s ... onscreen : dance like an idiot and sale is not a shame anymore . 
so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like , with interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos;re easy to do , and they have interesting lifelike properties , maybe these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on earth , and maybe they &apos;re going to take a very easy step , one of the first steps that life on the early earth has begun . 
i like to give to the hobbyhistorians , so i spent some time trying to figure out when the first time was mentioned , the best quote i could find was by david livingstone , who wrote in the 1850s how east africa was embedded by railway , steam ship and telegraph in the rest of the world . 
it &apos;s being used in terms of a report from 2007 research council in the united states that you &apos;re trying to understand how to look for life elsewhere in the universe , ok , especially if this life is very different from our planet . if we could come to another planet and think there might be life , how could we recognize this life as such a one ? 
others are pretty structurally , for example , borrowing , who have an impact in the social sector : collecting funds that are invested to keep up youth of crime , or to help old people remain healthy and keep up with hospitals . the retail measures the success of the projects that you &apos;ve invested in . 
i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa did not hire captain kirk and spock for the job ; after all , they were very experienced -- but as a child , i had to say , as my grandmother often said to me , that , &quot; the impossible is just the one that can &apos;t strive enough . &quot; 
let &apos;s move on to the south of our world , we can go to the amazon bolivian edge , we can go to the amazons here in 1975 , and if you look very carefully , there &apos;s a little white line going through , like a rock riss , and there &apos;s a builder out there , in the middle of the ancient jungle . 
venice is sinking in italy . to save it , rachel armstrong says we need to move beyond the architecture of inert materials , to grow up and create an architecture that self-assembles . she suggests a non-whole living material that is self-repairing and cuts carbon dioxide . 
but i want to show you different ways of dealing with difficulty and just getting to the point , so much faster to find a solution -- at least faster than arthur . so , first of all , we &apos;re going to cheat the common sense , the logic . it &apos;s to everybody . it &apos;s supposed to help your hand act like that , 90-degree wincles . not that . 
we believe that with a one-hour flight , we can transform the textbooks about mars by pulling out high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gas and volcanic origins , studying the surface , studying the magnetism on the surface that we don &apos;t understand , and also about a dozen other areas . 
it &apos;s the process of mindfuling that keeps me a little bit over the constant concern in my life , and it &apos;s the sense of &quot; 80 percent of the project &quot; you know that you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not done , and you don &apos;t start doing anything -- that really does my life . 
just at the time when the internet became an educator commercial , i left wisconsin , and went to kansas , the little city of kansas , where i got the opportunity to teach , in a dirty little town , a rural school in kansas , where i taught my favorite subject policy . 
because , when you poison yourself by being the low-cost producer to send it to the low-cost salesman -- wal-mart -- and then we send them all our money . what we find is we actually have something that , when i was a student , we called common destruction . 
sam harris : yeah , well , i think i &apos;ve tried to address that in one sentence while i &apos;ve missed the time , but the question is , what does &apos; voluntary &apos; mean , &apos; in a context where men have certain expectations , and you anticipate in some way if you don &apos;t dare . 
so if we want to track something that spreads in a network , we would ideally embedded sensors on the central people in the network , including nodes a , watching people who are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow getting an early detection of what &apos;s going on in the network . 
at an economic angle , the demand for any kind of art is shooting through the ceiling , which is the prices of prices in the opera , the number of books sold , the number of books published books , the number of publishing musicians , the number of new albs , and so on . 
and what &apos;s even more important is that we &apos;re going to get away from the oil and we want to make it wider -- there are so many possibilities in this country as well as in many countries in africa -- what was worth a lot of this growth was not just from the oil sector , but from other areas that had nothing to do with oil . 
even though you &apos;re looking for a drug that aging can prevent , in old men like me , what you might do pretty well in the lab atorium , if you were to ethically , is it to create human life with modified genes that would make it possible to live much longer ? 
so the message is clear : whether you &apos;re interested in fundamental , deep research , or interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or whether you want to build a search and mountain robot that can help in a earthquake or save someone from a fire , or whether you &apos;re interested in medicine , we have to save the blueprints of nature . 
and what patient capital means is that i realized over the last month , because the company was literally 10 days away from the reference that her product was enough to the international standards that you need to make coartem when she got into the worst hurricane crisis of her story . 
and i &apos;ve been working on this , and i &apos;ve been working on a hierarchy , and i think about how many people make steps , and how many interesting variables , and people have a whole different theory , a lot more popular and older , and it &apos;s mostly based on john nash , and it &apos;s known from a beautiful mind , and it &apos;s called &quot; equal analysis . &quot; 
and to me , if you really want to rediscover the wonder , you have to emerge from your little , scared space of rightness and look at each other , and look out at the vast and complexity and the mystery of the universe , and be able to say , &quot; wow , i have no idea . 
but it makes the statement that distinguishes in a way between the real world of the people who make things , and the world of the people who think about things that contains the intellectual challenge : we make things as simple as possible , as inexpensive as possible , so functional as possible , and so freely linked as possible ? 
and as soon as they were all there , a whole pile of these solar parachutes that they had in the old india made a kind of special effect that turned them into a giant planetarium , the miracle of the universe . everybody looked in and they saw the full comment of all life in all universes . 
luckily , the mother of invention is still necessary , and a large part of the design work that we &apos;re on on our airplane at the most tricky was a result that we had to solve the unique problems that were linked to doing it on the ground -- everything from a continuous variables , and a cooling system with refrigeration that allows us to use a creator machine in the stop-go transport , up to a specific passenger , that will either drift the propeller , or when you &apos;re going to the ground and if you &apos;re going to see a tractors in the same way . 
and i &apos;m trying to show -- unfortunately , the colors aren &apos;t coming out very well -- that these little five year-old bubbles of time that they &apos;re worried about , and you &apos;re going to tend to be interested in the last and future generation -- parents , children -- things that you can change in the next decades -- and they &apos;re moving in that 50-year time bubble , and if you look at the population , they realize that in that 50 years the human population is more than two and a half , we &apos;re three and a half times as many times as they &apos;re born , they get more than when they &apos;re born . 
th : one of the reasons that makes it interesting and appropriate is to be here at tedwomen , is that -- well , when dinner was best summarized , when someone said , &quot; turn you to your desk and say to you , &apos; when the revolution starts , we support you . &apos; &quot; the truth , women is that we &apos;ve already been supporting you on this topic for a long time . in rael carchson , with silspring &apos;s &quot; pino borns to download our future . 
we decided to do something a little different , and we turned flavors around that were very familiar -- so in this case , we take a carrot , put it in a mixer , and then we kind of have a carrot judge juice juice juice juice juice juice , and then it came into a balloon , frozen in liquid nitrogen , to make that holder web out of carrot i used to say , and then arranges it , and then it looks like you can see , as if you &apos;re frozen pite around your web plate . 
the fuel , as i said before , is dressed in ceramics with circulatory fires , and in an accident in such a reactor , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three miles island , we haven &apos;t discovered this for a long time -- but these circuitations at the fuel sites , when they &apos;re in high pressure , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they produce hydrogen and that explosible explosives the ability to create fission products . 
one of the ironies of that time is that we discuss a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , in fact , it &apos;s still a source of debate about what this black current is made of matter , and where it comes from . the best explanation and one of the best assumptions about this matter is that these plants form out of this kind of sunlight , under pressure for millions of years , and the result is this black rivers . 
i was taken by an inspector brian cantera from royal canadian mounted police to half in the east vancouvers to see what kind of goods are commonly infected by the rcmp of jewels , which , of course , send them to the south , to the united states , where an unsavored market for british columbia bud , as it is called , especially because it &apos;s been labeled as organically , which is especially good in california . 
i grew up in the pacific northwest , where a lot of members of the church of jesu christi of the saints of the last few days have been working with them , and i even had a couple of them , but whose doctrine i didn &apos;t know or didn &apos;t know what they were telling people when they were on a mission , and it seemed to be a little curious , and so i said , &quot; oh , please come in and i think they &apos;re really happy . i don &apos;t think this often happen to you . 
in the face of that , i &apos;d like to say a few words about resolution and tell a little bit about my new project , and this project is different from the previous one , but both promoting exactly the same properties of self-learning , learning by learning , by learning , of self-exploration and the construction of communities . this is a project that &apos;s involved with mathematics for all the pressures in high school , and we do this on tablepcs , because we think maths should be taught to be taught . 
i was walking around the street with amsterdam , and i realized that the important thing in amsterdam was not in the design stores , but out in the street , and maybe it &apos;s explained by itself , but it &apos;s a city that has not been shrinked from modernism , but has perceived its architecture and its character , in the bicycles , in the ways people move and the rights of the pedestrians are protected . 
they say the right thing , and whoever gets elected , is perhaps going to do the right thing , but i want to tell you , when i came back from kyoto in 1997 with a big sense of happiness , we had a breakthrough , and then confronted the senate of the united states , it was only one in 100 senators ready to confirm that contract and reconfirm it , and that &apos;s what the candidate has to say , with what people are saying . 
and finally , i think as well as we test flamboxes in an inferno way to make sure that they don &apos;t catch fire when our child gets across the herd , also these stories of families that overcome these extreme differences that reflect universal experience of parenting , that are always running out of it , that sometimes you look at your child and you say , &quot; what planet do you get from ? &quot; 
mythos nr. 2 : orpheus , a fellow , charmant , to his nearby , to be party lion , great singer , loses his favorite , refuse his way to the underworld -- the only person who has done it with charms in the underworld -- fence the gods of the underworld , they leave his beauty under a condition ; they &apos;re not allowed to look at it until they &apos;re out . 
this is a paper form . and what you see here is a form in the hands of a nurse of the ministry of health in indonesia going around in the rural area , certainly hot and wet day in indonesia , and it will be knocking on thousands of doors in a period of weeks or months , and they &apos;ll come and ask , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions . 
finally , about the 16th century , a physicus whose name was theophrastus bastus auricularis of hohenhome , called paracelsus , was probably a name that probably some people here know -- the good paracelsus that he could predict the magnitude of the convulsions by solving an abundant amount of combat to dissolve the convulsions . 
the times a human being , a business or a brand , were able to control exactly about their reputation , are past -- online gossip and a lot of endeavors that if you &apos;re important , all of the time you &apos;re talking about is not control . tim leberreal presents three suggestions of accepting that control loss and even putting it on him -- and using it as a shock person to react to their own values . 
the third item on my checklist is the relationships of our neighborhoods that can support a society , and if that friendly support falls down , it can contribute to a society &apos;s collapse , and the greenland norse are fueling in greenland with the native country , with norway , and that trade has become less partly because norway has become weaker , partly because the sea has been under-border and northern frozen . 
but it &apos;s different from the cars that have developed so fast and ordered that the school system is actually detectable a heritage of the 19th century , by a bike model of germany that has been picked up by english reformers , and often the religious missionary in the united states , as a means of social collapse , and then in japan and then south korea , as they evolved . 
the thunfish team topp has done the unthinkable : three teams have labeled 1700 tuna , bluefin , yellowfin and white tuna , all at the same time -- with carefully contested tagging tagging , where we &apos;re going to go out , get teenage tuna , see their own sensors , see sensors inside , and then release them . 
the public loses their faith in democracy , says the british parliament rory stewart . the new democracies in iraq and afghanistan are through and corrupt . at the same time , 84 percent of the british politics is broken . in this talk , stewart calls for democracy to rebuild , he says , beginning to discover why democracy is important -- not as a means of ideal , but as ideal . 
and hopefully , they &apos;re also for this idea that engineers and designers are using all these different kinds of climate parameters to make it possible to create really good and comfortable open-air conditions in order to change our thermal perception , so that we &apos;re comfortable in an outdoor field , we &apos;re able to do it with the best passive design , but also using the source of energy in the basket of the cat , the sun . 
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to the rules , we look at whether we can really wait for incentives , even if the people we want to do with , not in our interests , it &apos;s in their interest to act in our interests -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing , even if they &apos;re in their own self-interest . 
and as the animal knows , click , feed , click , feed , feed , click , feed it , feed it , feed it -- so that click means feed -- bring it into a cage with a hole . basically , the animal learns to stick its nose into the hole , under the smell of the target target , it takes five seconds -- it &apos;s a long time for a rat . 
i think that patterns have the ability to erase some of the most evil forces in society , such as bad men in the restaurant , but seriously , what you see is how the aggressivity of the industrialized world has created this -- huge masses of things -- monocultures , and i think that the preservation of cultural diversity is very important to us . 
and if you &apos;re afraid that something like a guaranteed income is going to be made by our success course in the germ and somehow to make us feel seldom , you might be interested in the social mobility , one of the things we &apos;re really proud of in the united states , now it &apos;s lower than in the northern european countries that have these very generous social security networks . 
this picture suggests that a radical change in the way that information is produced and is used exchange . it &apos;s not less capital intensity , it doesn &apos;t require less money , but ownership of capital , the way capitalization does , is radically decentralized . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of them , or something like that , is a computer . 
i don &apos;t know if you know that , but -- maybe it &apos;s different today , or you wanted to do something about it -- but in many hospitals in the country , you could , according to a book by jessica benjamin , until recently , read little boys about the children , &quot; i &apos;m a boy . &quot; and the clue of the little girls was , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . right . &quot; 
in october , we put two titles on the market -- rockett &apos;s new school , which is the first part of a series of products about a character called rockett , which starts its first school day , in eighth grade , in a whole new place , entirely without history . that allows the girl to play with questions like , &quot; how am i going to be when i &apos;m older ? &quot; 
and my favorite example of this was in the beginning of 1976 , when it was realized that the bacteria that were causing legional scarcity had always existed in natural waters , but it was the precise temperature of water in heat , ventilation and climate systems , which caused real conditions for maximum production of the legionella bazillus . 
if we could bring the nonprofit donations of two percent by investing in growth , a level higher , to three percent of gdp , that would be 150 billion dollars more revenue , and that money would flow directly into health services and social services , because we put those in investments in the foreground , that would mean a triple of the donation in this sector . 
these people are taking their money and investing in an interesting thing , and i think that &apos;s much better than when you put it into a better mobile phone or something like that -- but they &apos;re investing in a very &#91; unclear &#93; , and so we &apos;re going to get these options , and that &apos;s going to lead to the next big thing , and that &apos;s going to allow us to explore , and i think , eventually , we &apos;re going to start exploring colonies and we &apos;re going to be able to prevent our extinctions . 
but i think that the united states and the european states , in order to maintain its global impact , may have to think about how to cooperate short-term , in order to compete , and in doing so , they may have to focus more aggressive on economic success to help create a middle class , so that they can take the government responsibility and build the democracy that we really want .
