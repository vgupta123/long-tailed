you can try it . 
that &apos;s our average budget . 
so nothing is getting through . 
it was a huge success . 
hope kept me alive . 
king of spades . 
their voters are local . 
i experience exponentially . 
some of them are very easy . 
that person doesn &apos;t exist today . 
thank you very much for listening . 
lg : you &apos;re welcome . 
and your children are playing instruments . 
here &apos;s something that drives me crazy . 
south africa is playing a role . 
thank you . 
but one day , something happened . 
how true for lincoln . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
fake madness . 
pull the knot . 
unspeakably dangerous . 
you can &apos;t catch me . 
behavioral markers matter . 
a hanger . 
you &apos;re un-owned . 
so new life was born . 
but now one final thing . 
totally transformed by man . 
thanks very much for your attention . 
this boy is called messoud . 
people didn &apos;t know about things . 
it has an extremely important function . 
margarine didn &apos;t exist . 
even this problem , too complicated . 
strong feelings can create a model . 
because we can &apos;t solve problems . 
nm : not too fast . 
you can use it at ted . 
ugh . mini-me . 
they &apos;re going to become numbers . 
it was mind-blowing . 
because no one &apos;s really watching . 
schools can &apos;t be silos . 
but it was really brutal . 
1.6 million deaths worldwide . 
art is the ultimate goal . 
thank you all of you . 
i had never seen an internet . 
because i am hiv positive . 
this is five times larger . 
second it &apos;s driving itself . 
2006 was a great year . 
momentum has been building . 
i &apos;m not quite sure . 
but i can taste things . 
almost out of kindergarten . 
i just wanted a video camera . 
it &apos;s our invisible reality . 
they &apos;re very little understood . 
i got a lot wrong . 
real dependence on this person . 
and often it does something more . 
the rules are mystifying . 
this one i thought i &apos;d show you . 
some conspiracies really are true . 
the network has two components in them . 
that &apos;s why we must adapt . 
i will be attending aims . 
don &apos;t give in to the wall . 
there &apos;s a flip side as well . 
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot; 
they &apos;ve had some speakers there . 
this is a collaboration we have with stanford . 
a guy goes into a psychiatrist . 
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells . 
so thank you and thank you for listening . 
every top adds up to 37 . 
but i had a lot of fun . 
and we gave the film over . 
all of these technologies we can use . 
but that &apos;s true for adults too . 
next best thing to a video game . 
sounds ridiculous , right . 
but people live on this land . 
there are no quick fixes . 
this story began four years ago . 
she ended up underneath the car . 
feynman loved this story . 
so i was inspired by a friend . 
he realized at once what had happened . 
they use mobutu as metaphor . 
so these are my daughters . 
commentator : there he is . 
the next movement is called mobs . 
step by step , it does narrow . 
i called in 26 children . 
have a great session . 
i &apos;m built to last . 
somebody get the front legs . 
it &apos;s very powerful work . 
i love that phrase . 
they were missing the vision . 
let &apos;s start with business . 
i lost my face . 
so whimsy matters . 
it &apos;s getting near zero . 
got a couple questions for you . 
i am not making this up . 
so here &apos;s another asteroid . 
here are some recent images . 
you can send them an email . 
so he tried plan b . 
these are survival skills . 
i really thought they were so beneath me . 
there is , in fact , another stage . 
this now is the third different output . 
well , then we get to this image . 
faces of all kinds are easy to see . 
they are very dedicated and committed . 
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible . 
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dissection . 
so the fishermen are catching more . 
i was just staggered by it . 
guns are not a part of our lives . 
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff . 
and so i had this t.v. show . 
it &apos;s 130 octane fuel . 
be proud that you have them . 
but i wish it were better . 
it &apos;s a nice motivator . 
which i think is just fascinating . 
that &apos;s the current business model . 
but it slightly bores me . 
but for us it meant freedom . 
they are farmers and factory workers . 
we did it in three steps . 
there &apos;s no ice over it . 
let me ask you a question . 
dp : thank you very much . 
we have superstar bankers . 
a photo is not enough . &quot; 
you and your kids are fine . 
unfortunately , the answer is yes . 
let &apos;s watch just another clip . 
this gave me a greater faith . 
the classrooms have no walls . 
there &apos;re a lot of elements . 
and the short answer is games . 
this is a 15 year-old boy . 
i was so wasted . &quot; 
you &apos;ve believed it through generations . 
they were together while praying . 
so i moved on from there . 
which was making me more nervous . 
i did this building in japan . 
we have effective therapies now . 
i was born in algeria . 
it comes back to instinct . 
the date was february 2000 . 
i end with a few quotes . 
but look what we just did today . 
the industry average is about 65 percent . 
it &apos;s all incredibly humble material . 
now i think it &apos;s too easy . 
for each project we do a film . 
and then finally , electric vehicles . 
but then paul got in the water . 
it &apos;s not a priority . &quot; 
but that really isn &apos;t true anymore . 
fg : i don &apos;t know . 
so nature has this self-similar structure . 
there has to be something better . &quot; 
i &apos;m not connecting to them . 
&quot; he was flattered . 
we &apos;ve all heard these things . 
this is about my friend brennan . 
that &apos;s it without the case on . 
i think this is an interesting question . 
values are a certain kind of fact . 
i have a global vision for vision . 
no matter where on earth you live . 
the earth moved for both of them . 
along the way , you lost something . 
so , certainly the challenge was there . 
i love these gallianos . 
the machine itself would start the music . 
and i like that kind of response . 
so let &apos;s first talk about biology . 
this is called &quot; thirst . &quot; 
so a natural answer is 99 percent . 
i was born in new york city . 
humanity is going to go down this path . 
i wound up on every television show . 
a print subscription for 125 . 
liberation , however , costs some money . 
it disintegrates a few months later . 
it is about the state of the planet . 
and yet , nobody listened to them . 
so it was a pretty successful evening . 
now this has raised all sorts of questions . 
he had to issue a reply . 
i could work them just by my thoughts . 
please , also on the balcony . 
the first one she did was knitting . 
i &apos;m 43 years old right now . 
tell that guy to wait half an hour . 
let me demonstrate how it works . 
and you need to re-set it up . 
this is in a place called san francisco . 
this is part of our collective narrative . 
but you need to look at context . 
the technology revolution is opening the world . 
that can be a big contribution . 
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity . 
we have to make the right moral decision . 
bp : i was born old . 
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives . 
from there i started with skydiving . 
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t . 
they &apos;re not a big deal for us . 
it learns very much from its mistakes . 
let &apos;s think about data for a bit . 
but it was not to be that simple . 
you can only do them one at a time . 
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here . 
most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly . 
so , this is an astounding table . 
so we have this database of things . 
my life was not going to be the same . 
you read about it in your newspapers . 
and we define ourselves by our gaps . 
there are these &quot; wizards &quot; everywhere . 
this just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times . 
we are obsessed with this way of thinking . 
we have to make this available for people . &quot; 
that &apos;s what a hydrophilic surface does . 
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation . 
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us . 
they become aware . they achieve autonomy . 
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool . 
so let me show you how this works . 
they do all aspects of the work . 
now , it was logistically difficult . 
there is no orchestra conductor . 
and it &apos;s terribly endangered . 
so we came up with these two rules . 
there &apos;s a point to be made here . 
so now you put the two things together . 
i work with some of the most amazing people . 
i thought the word framework was great . 
but really , it &apos;s pretty robust . 
here &apos;s an example from that screening study . 
we want to play you one more selection . 
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing . 
but of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves . 
i couldn &apos;t fit them in . 
it &apos;s focus and presence . 
this is a video prototype . 
they have graphic designers . what ? 
yet we have these files . 
it did not happen overnight . 
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot; 
and frog mode . 
so let &apos;s filter that out . 
so , people talk about political will . 
europe was not spared either . 
the survey takes over a day . 
enter the atomic bomb . 
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect . 
but this is great fun for children . 
and we are vulnerable . 
now , the other use of this is practical . 
presumably , they mean something supernatural . 
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to convince congress . 
the first gentleman , he &apos;s a baker . 
what we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated . 
so i have a huge amount of choice to make . 
that is a lot of punch for 14 words . 
and something festered inside me after this happened . 
that would be bad for economies and cities . 
so , i was trying to basically make measurements . 
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago . 
which is the job that i have to show you today . 
you know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive . 
now at the time , i was working down the street . 
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life . 
as we know , only half the states have opted in . 
it really just works like a huge iphone . 
i &apos;m a designer and an educator . 
and let me show you what happened . 
so the seemingly impossible is possible . 
but they want to use it -- seriously . 
it was three days , four meals . 
and then i &apos;ve mentioned the availability . 
and the world population will stop growing . 
he ran and worked in a factory . 
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation . 
you get something a little bit more complicated . 
but it was a little bit boring . 
everybody : i am my connectome . 
it &apos;s more with less and less again . 
then we like to take things apart . 
we also need the choices for people . 
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence . 
that &apos;s just one benefit of that . 
it &apos;s good for motivated students . 
half of them gave over the internet . 
this is another leader of his people . 
and the mother is elderly . 
here &apos;s a wonderful fractal . 
is it all worked out ? no . 
we need one today more than ever . 
that is the power of organic design . 
so you go to the literature . 
and we cannot have all the answers . 
the world needs an international forum . 
this is very exciting for those players . 
it &apos;s flown around the world . 
these young boys are in nepal . 
and that &apos;s how it populates this map . 
the survivors came in one by one . 
i want you to take a trip with me . 
here it &apos;s &quot; candycity . &quot; 
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this . 
but we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better . 
your baby is going to be hiv-negative . &quot; 
people really can learn a language with it . 
adg : in persuading them . 
the next phase it hit was displacement . 
over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land . 
i &apos;m talking also about christianity . 
they &apos;re all mounted on my instruments . 
this came in , like , six different colors . 
that &apos;s a multimedia-tasker . 
but he made mistakes in a good direction . 
today , we &apos;ve worked with over 300 . 
the bush administration did not even respond . 
why ? because you want our diamond . 
it &apos;s much like on a jet . 
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future . 
so we &apos;re going to watch another film . 
but still , we look at the pieces . 
i &apos;m under the river with those fish . 
i go back to color all the time . 
and i had the same reaction you did . 
and that will have led to specialization . 
that &apos;s our job as cosmologists . 
contagious is a good word . 
i have a bunch of other inventions . 
chris bangle : great cars are great art 
so you get the best of both worlds . 
and we do not want to wait another hundred years . 
and they may not want to live exactly like us . 
the design of the body is a whole different thing . 
and then what comes out of it ? new life . 
you get a job and get out of the house . 
ts : those are permanent magnets , yeah . 
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ? 
i painted it directly on top of the man . 
it &apos;s based on purchasing power parity . 
and a little kid from the back was like this . 
i &apos;d like to share a couple with you today . 
finally catches up to itself , it advances . 
i met a guy -- the guy on the left . 
you can just make it physically on the spot . 
and so now we &apos;re in for some serious play . 
the foot is distributed along the whole leg . 
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever . 
so it goes in and it stays there . 
but that &apos;s not really the question i &apos;m asking . 
the larvae have to develop very quickly . 
sherman &apos;s up in shark heaven . 
that &apos;s the pantheon next to it . 
and one day , we went for a meeting . 
they &apos;re going to eddy in lagos . 
and i did a little calculation of this . 
it &apos;s a branching off from the human form . 
so that &apos;s our biologic approach right now . 
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light . 
tumor cells can travel through the blood vessels . 
she is really the center of the health care system . 
and we also sampled the outdoor air . 
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter . 
now is there any alternative to this ? 
and finally the chinese cracked down . 
i make the dove appear . 
we have focused on the problems . 
explain to me what &apos;s wrong . 
and we will do other centers . 
and this is just an illustration . 
you get it every time . 
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things . 
and sequel truly is a real car . 
and this is hedy lamarr . 
and they sat on it for months actually . 
and you could stuff pins in them . 
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect . 
don &apos;t worry about the numbers . 
again , this is no mere hypothetical . 
and i can &apos;t emphasize that enough , you know . 
i am a native of burkina faso . 
it also provides a third of the food we eat . 
it &apos;s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come . 
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ? 
and yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much . 
he was out there in parol delivering a baby . 
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again . 
so , we &apos;ve been conducting a lot of research . 
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution . 
and one of them is the lacking buying power . 
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that . 
all the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ... 
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of neat . 
and they are not the only one that makes the crossing . 
the engineering is , truthfully , the easy part of this . 
the bee is not calling the shots . 
we &apos;re designing for this machine dialect . 
china symbolized by the dragon . 
there &apos;s no delusion through the phone . 
now she thinks the powder is sugar . 
and then there is static apnea . 
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret . 
what would that mean ? i have no idea . 
thomas batuik : hi there , eric . 
this is a game with 50,000 individual pieces . 
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done . 
these are the next two lines in the movie . 
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot; 
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have . 
and now people from iran are talking to me . 
wires suck , they really do . 
it is transparent , made just for you . 
and this was not a misplaced feeling . 
and so i ended up walking like this . 
it would change his day , all right ? 
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before . 
but nobody actually demonstrated it , right ? 
but still , now we have global warming . 
think of the financial world , for example . 
doubt and fear always creep in . 
people are watching us all around , &quot; right ? 
most of these are candidates . 
see what the wars in rwanda . 
let &apos;s call them the killer apps . 
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ? 
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ? 
that has not happened at all in space flying . 
i &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand . 
seventy percent of the population didn &apos;t want this . 
now in this recipe you also have the cost . 
skepticism , because you must always be challenging . 
all of these things were made during the last 75 years . 
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front porch . 
you &apos;re focusing on him ! this is steve jobs . 
and he signs off , &quot; thank you . &quot; 
so there are up to a million people there everyday . 
it doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ? 
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them . 
i can peel off the layer of the lion . 
so i had a really quite happy life at indiana . 
all of us have disabilities in one form or another . 
now , without that , how could we possibly function ? 
the first number is three : three billion people . 
this is a piece of property in brentwood . 
how long will it take it to fill it up ? 
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the ipad . 
that &apos;s a person down there by the wheel . 
that exacerbates and continues this model . 
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house . 
the guy on the left is a safe bonus . 
what is fuzzy rope , you ask ? 
and it &apos;s awfully windy over there . 
there are thousands of suppliers in there . &quot; 
and this is what i saw , lots of fish . 
and all we &apos;ve got is a roomba . 
so this is the space during tutoring hours . 
i write the code that fits the world today . 
and , most importantly , what causes the clusters ? 
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians . 
do you want to do it , france ? 
and she said , &quot; i learned something today . 
in north korea , i made it myself . 
we started to look out in other fields . 
and she said , just talk about yourself . 
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer . 
how would i know who was the best ? 
this is considered the five blessings . 
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood . 
it &apos;s completely silent and nonpolluting . 
and i looked at it underneath the microscope . 
and this noise is the most neutral . 
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-awareness . 
the idea is called the social impact bond . 
the dolphin &apos;s at the keyboard . 
i need some information , and i need a container . 
rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is &quot; rendering . &quot; 
the tone-deaf people , they &apos;re no longer here . 
they set up their own bazaars and medical clinics . 
but equally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential . 
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice . 
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right . 
in a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps . 
that is , our housing has become a commodity . 
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere . 
i am the happiest , the happiest person in the world . 
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot; 
it was the largest empire the world had known until then . 
in fact , they &apos;ve accounted for half of all civil wars . 
here &apos;s an example of the puzzle you &apos;re going to solve . 
so i did try to take , again , a climb altitude . 
and this energy , according to einstein , exerts a push on the universe . 
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things . 
and now the king cobra is a new one . 
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important . 
it &apos;s a bit eerie , isn &apos;t it ? 
so , children are not empty vessels , ok ? 
but it will not be possible in the future any more . 
the answer is what i call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot; 
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fingered speech . 
you should have always a structure of living and working together . 
so what do we do ? we connect more and more . 
and we use all of them , even the toxic ones . 
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot; 
that pulls in more material and pulls in more material . 
and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney . 
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world . 
is this really how economies behave ? &quot; 
all his colleagues said , &quot; this is outrageous . 
david griffin : how photography connects us 
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world . 
and the same pattern emerged in each conflict . 
we didn &apos;t see anything like that in africa . 
and i thought about a solution to this problem . 
it &apos;s really our first foray into this . 
efharisto and kalinihta . 
this is another species of work that i do . 
and i want my music to be with you . &quot; 
this is the vibrio fischeri molecule . 
and parallel to my cutting is my running . 
europe had to be dragged into economic development . 
we don &apos;t see those nuclear reactions in stars . 
and he came up to me and he knocked . 
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ? 
my work is -- it &apos;s a reflection of myself . 
and that &apos;s what i do with my furniture . 
this is a kind of optical deal , right ? 
how is it possible to do this without a brain ? 
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , huh ? 
bc : we enter the martian atmosphere . 
intercropping . intercropping really increases income . 
in fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows . 
no . there will still be paper dictionaries . 
in arkansas they don &apos;t even ask . &quot; 
two -- and it was two of spades , right ? 
now , how do we deduce where the galaxy is ? 
so , this is what happened when pnas published this . 
we were talking about the rapture ? it &apos;s coming . 
our school would show bill nye the science guy . 
this is not just in hebrew , by the way . 
this is a remote center at the university of washington . 
just fold up the wings and keep going . 
the perspective was , here is this poor professor . 
maira kalman : the illustrated woman 
the u.s. constitution is the gay agenda . 
you know when they do homeworks at home ? 
but the story is not about these chapters . 
we put the beeper in the clinic . 
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ? 
and actually i &apos;m a little visually impaired myself . 
there is a full-blown orchestra living inside the building . 
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side . 
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival . 
and it &apos;s a real shame . now why has this come about ? 
they do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes . 
all we ask is , &quot; what serves my interests ? &quot; 
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity . 
this is called &quot; the captain &apos;s hat story . &quot; 
you know something ? this has been achieved in india . 
watch the mental workload , and watch the steering . 
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ? 
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about that . &quot; 
every city , county , state did their own thing . 
who are these characters who are so damn happy ? 
that &apos;s what you get furious about right ? 
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ? 
we became much more social . the social networks expanded . 
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes . 
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &quot; 
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger . 
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent . 
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at . 
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only . 
this is the warp and weft . 
this next decade is the decade of games . 
it will be completely free , and it will work in any browser . 
i am a neuroscientist with a mixed background in physics and medicine . 
that sounds like a winner ; we &apos;ll go with it . &quot; 
and one of them is called taketa . which is which ? 
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero . 
and they assemble , and they form these kinds of mechanisms . 
once you &apos;ve done that , then there &apos;s the computation step . 
in this case , we put two chimpanzees side-by-side . 
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; ugh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do . 
if a newt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ? 
i &apos;ll tell you how big the lever is : the lever is that big . 
and then you enter into the living room and then so on . 
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him . 
how do you ensure it gets to them and it improves their lives ? 
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is luck ? 
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference . 
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation . 
it stretches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here . 
and i say , &quot; cate , what do you want to do ? &quot; 
i could barely breathe . i was gasping for air . 
so , i will close with this . these are my older people . 
that &apos;s all , shukran . thank you very much for the opportunity . 
that implication was studied by boltzmann back in the 19th century . 
it &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses . 
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song . 
&quot; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &quot; 
and i read it , and it was just -- it was crap . 
you can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing . 
and now to introduce their music video , we have ok go . 
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ? 
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world . 
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet . 
it was really hot . i was very hungry . 
i built the head . they built the body . 
very advanced , no air-conditioning -- i love it . 
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ? 
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the reception desk . 
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones . 
this is the math underlying the 80 / 20 rule . right ? 
so then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot; 
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children . 
take it from me . under the bed is not a good hiding spot . 
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ? 
and they feature as their role models really great salesmen . 
dr. v : see , mcdonald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple . 
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a screed . 
i couldn &apos;t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it . 
we could do circular narratives that were literally circular . 
there are two things that can really accelerate this whole process . 
this i found , where nature had made a picture for me . 
this is what i tend to see almost more than contradictions . 
but later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot . 
i knew him once , but then he was a boy . 
would they give me charts and graphs that i could color ? 
i hope there aren &apos;t any snail rights activists around here . 
a change in commitment . a new sense of urgency . 
in short , we admire their willingness to play . 
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on . 
so i decided to talk to women about their vaginas . 
it really should be called the recovery or return of asia . 
dyslexic , so i &apos;m a bit slow . 
you might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees . 
one is another american inventor ted henter . 
you should get points for doing this on time . 
you &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot; 
and stop with the labels , the limiting . 
i put my flippers on . i could barely part my lips . 
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the compositions of its population . 
and i had to quit and come and do this thing called a better place . 
so the question is , how hard would it be to assemble this , right ? 
&quot; we don &apos;t care about being happy . we need to live with passion . 
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronomical union . 
he &apos;s a dog that belongs to a family in mombasa in kenya . 
i didn &apos;t see anyone else . we took this photo next to the helicopter . 
and they belong on the sidewalks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot; 
so if you &apos;ve sent three specimens , it &apos;s an hour later . 
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity . 
now , ascap said they didn &apos;t care . 
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do . 
this is a room full of intelligent people , highly sensitive . 
but we were expected to have doubts ; we &apos;re expected to have fears . 
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whistling since the age of four , about four . 
but i &apos;m not going to change anything within those boxes , except their meaning . 
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure . 
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vacuum , you know . 
and what do you dedicate it to , in exploring a particular thing ? 
for some reason , there &apos;s no standard syllabus , there &apos;s no basic course . 
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings . 
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the starlight comes out from . 
two norwegians did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it solo . 
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time . 
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on . 
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe native americans were there . 
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident . 
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news . 
i said , &quot; mrs. alisch , how are you ? &quot; 
top right is stuart moore , a writer for iron man . 
and this word here , george bush called this war a crusade . 
down here i noticed this . is this something of yours , sir ? 
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot; 
you could rob 200 people on a train , a great innovation . 
we also see sharks , much more regularly than i would have expected to . 
avelile had the virus , she was born with the virus . 
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a condom . 
the deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water . 
i want to start off by saying , houston , we have a problem . 
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ceos , cmos . 
and i came from a very privileged background . i was very lucky . 
that &apos;s kind of ridiculous . it &apos;s a total decoy . 
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise , surprise . 
so there &apos;s a lot more female gamers than people are really aware . 
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that . 
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-evolution . 
now i &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this . 
now , the conventional wisdom was that nigerians don &apos;t read literature . 
pm : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning . 
so , i &apos;ve no time to go into all the different scientific results . 
and then we say , &quot; well how do we line them all up ? &quot; 
on the banks of a river called the indus , now in pakistan . 
don &apos;t black-box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door . 
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this . 
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media . 
if this does not blow your mind , then you have no emotion . 
first , no real sports fan would talk that way . 
let &apos;s create a word processor that &apos;s just a word processor . 
that actually occurred this year . she took early retirement . 
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed . 
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law . 
it makes failure invisible , inconceivable and inevitable . 
we stumbled on it , looking for some missing heat . 
the battery is not the gas tank , in a sense . 
life is a right , not collateral or casual . 
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes . 
your brand starts being dispersed , it gets more chaotic . 
my brain started telling me , jane , you want to die . 
i just have time to read a more recent poem to you . 
judge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand . 
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times . 
you go in along the shore , you can find it everywhere . 
i would percuss the chest . i would listen to the heart . 
if human beings disappeared , life on earth as we know it would flourish . &quot; 
but i recited a cheer . i recited a cheer along with everybody else . 
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days . 
i think it &apos;s important to promote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves . 
some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers , which is encouraging . 
we &apos;re going to hear from two people who are on the sharp end of the law . 
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- documents , data ? 
but there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different . 
if you don &apos;t say the right creative thing , you &apos;re going to be judged . 
at the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami . 
so when i was born , i guess you could say expectations were kind of high for me . 
there are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile . 
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside . 
so we had our own miniature rainforest , a private beach with a coral reef . 
pm : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper . 
all right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans . 
i actually just assmed the pathologic sequence of events was settled science . 
and the dragonflies are there . i have reports from my various contacts . 
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do . 
but it is changing the equation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decision-making . 
so they eventually started matching their talents and skills to all of my needs . 
if you could do all of them , you would have a very precise theory . 
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friendly he was getting . 
only 90 days after this , arguably the greatest discovery of the last century occurred . 
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot; 
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not slacker , lazy fish . 
and when you expand their palates , you expand their vocabulary . 
a lot has been said here about women , i don &apos;t need to repeat it . 
if you don &apos;t have open spaces , you &apos;ve got to go there and open spaces . 
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets . 
it &apos;s simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted . 
the point being , this is going to be very , very intensive on the programming side . 
expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small . 
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me . 
but if you &apos;re like me , my humanity is more like a window . 
so we got some land that was donated by a local garden center . 
but that &apos;s the only -- no , we were only photographed twice . 
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different . 
he was a very good golfer , but he had a disability . 
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life . 
we have even managed to make the study of literature arcane . 
as a test case , i propose we start with american dancers . 
and if we can switch to slides -- all right , here we go . 
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gridlock . 
he came up with our name and logo . we &apos;re mission motors . 
here &apos;s a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 1999 . 
do you have a wallet on you ? joe : i don &apos;t . 
and you see , everybody &apos;s busy . there was no time to waste . 
look at homicide at the bottom , for god &apos;s sake . 
this is the great leap forward , when china fell down . 
decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing . 
we are programmed for something called procreative success . 
it &apos;s the 24-hour rolling african news channel . 
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws . 
extinction can come slowly , but sometimes it arrives fast . 
what we need is new exit strategies for arguments . 
so it &apos;s actually a multi-dimensional user interface . 
i sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are . 
this is still the way we &apos;re communicating messages about health . 
i tend to win those arguments , because i know the tricks . 
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down . 
if this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant . 
and i think that would look quite neat as an x-ray . 
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot; 
well , what i did with that was to access the linguistics literature . 
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body . 
we &apos;re not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses . 
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accountability often doesn &apos;t work . 
so it was a big commitment to drive to the lab to work multiple times . 
no , we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time . 
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divided into two camps . 
so this is the gulf of mexico , sparkling place full of fish . 
i have things to do , people to impress , and places to go . &quot; 
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same . 
when a word was mentioned , an image of it instantly appeared in his mind . 
in effect , the cancer cell was forgetting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell . 
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of unknowns . 
and what that means is that we originated in africa . it &apos;s written in our dna . 
now , my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work . 
we focused on a business model ; we insisted on skin in the game . 
he said , &quot; ok . i measured the height of a brick . 
and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away . 
i learned that she did not have to be abused because she is a woman . 
now , it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes . 
we should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it . 
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shut it , at this point . 
first , it &apos;s clearly a non-invasive , wireless form of communication . 
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better . 
we want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time . 
when the ice was flat or flattish , i could just about pull both . 
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work . 
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i mentor . 
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about openness . 
maybe 100,000 people have cochlear implants , which allow them to hear . 
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner . 
it turns out to have a forebrain one-fifteenth the size of a human . 
we have a growing user base of this , and we network domes . 
you can &apos;t talk about how lonely having a baby can be . 
so that &apos;s what those great meditators have been doing . 
there &apos;s a basic , profound acceleration of this evolutionary process . 
mud and minerals become substrate ; there are bacteria . 
the first problem is there &apos;s inadequate disaster response . 
think of it as a massive itunes for book type content . 
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up . 
this is a state diagram . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer . 
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends . 
there are now 22 cities that have veterans &apos; courts like this . 
so if you compare complexities to simplicity , it &apos;s also catching up in a way , too . 
and i think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time . 
they may have a lot of opinions about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terribly informed . 
to me it is something from theatre , and i will get back to that a little bit later . 
many authors feel this pressure , but non-western authors feel it more heavily . 
not only do phthalates pollute our environment , but they also pollute our bodies . 
using the very first telephone , watson was in fact dialed into the heavens . 
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace . 
what howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy . 
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this . 
so what we had them do was memorize this lower-left sound icon , please . 
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great mailing list . 
the world i envision for her -- how do i want men to be acting and behaving ? 
we didn &apos;t know about xkeyscore . we didn &apos;t know about cybertrans . 
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit backwards in time . 
but organs don &apos;t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say goodbye . 
and shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to switzerland . 
so julie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her asthma . 
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how pervasive this phenomena is . 
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut . 
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an intermission in my talk . 
if you don &apos;t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red . 
when they opened this one up , they found its stomach was full of plastic . 
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human symphony . 
now , there are around a thousand trucks and buses and cars there . 
what okolloh did would not have been possible without human generosity . 
so this whole subject-object thing has relevance to humor in this way . 
&quot; if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them . 
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl . 
when edison invented the light bulb , pretty much looked like this . 
to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1k of memory . 
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concepts . 
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies . 
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there . 
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible . 
then you don &apos;t need anything to control the car , except thinking about it . 
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ? 
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short straws . 
it just looks like a saddle you &apos;d put on a horse . 
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body . 
the government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024 . 
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built . 
ignore those creeping fears that we have finally hit the wall . 
you weed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail . 
but there &apos;s another class of simple things , which are also very important . 
and then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses . 
i went to west virginia , the most unhealthy state in america . 
and you can notice they have created a kind of false catchment . 
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the earth . 
so that meant she was incontinent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wastes . 
i mean , this is literally human beings with super-human strength and abilities . 
&quot; you &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot; 
i &apos;m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments . 
now , this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room . 
it &apos;s downhill from now on . i wanted to thank emeka and chris . 
that &apos;s not dirty enough . let &apos;s just stir that up a little bit . 
he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation . 
as you can see , a project evolves through a series of generations of design meetings . 
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension . 
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for langley . 
we started with a motor with a little lever , a little force transfuser . 
each month required 1,365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes . 
ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area , right there . 
imagine : many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm . 
you can see on the microscope slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time . 
and ivan puts his sandwich over here , on top of the pirate chest . 
but i could get a bit darker in the tube , but everything else would suffer . 
and interestingly , as i think back , they were the first true environmentalists . 
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal , who sat on my left . 
it was a national geographic expedition , but it was organized by the explorers club . 
they squirt them at each other , which is lovely and innocent . 
one person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person didn &apos;t . 
and they were probably pleased to see you on top of the time poll . 
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve forgotten their coat . 
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent . 
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discussed carefully . 
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chronicles a journey . 
but there was also many christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman . 
that &apos;s when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people . 
what happens when a city decides it &apos;s going to set other priorities ? 
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concentrate sunlight . 
your head now is 100 yards away , sailing through the air , ok ? 
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m preparing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease . 
it &apos;ll help my breathing . it &apos;ll do something for my pulse , maybe . 
this institution is government-backed and it has been the case for the past three decades . 
and this is a teapot i designed for alessi . 
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brains . 
i &apos;ve been banging on about this like i can &apos;t believe . 
when you eat like a primate , you can &apos;t afford both . 
only those three words and she left the airport . that &apos;s it . 
and it &apos;s a responsive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather . 
if you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up . 
you send a command down , it causes muscles to contract . 
and things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced . 
death : go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late . 
i &apos;m a marketer , and as a marketer , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control . 
there &apos;s never been an angel- or a venture-funded company where bad things didn &apos;t happen . 
and the way i sold livestock jobs is i showed off my drawings , i showed off pictures of things . 
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home . 
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god forbid , that they have to change their lifestyle . 
and the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that . 
life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures . 
i &apos;m sniffing this other dog &apos;s rear end , the owner &apos;s calling . &quot; 
you could drop an atom bomb on a city , and 30 years later it &apos;s surviving . 
but overthrowing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated . 
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a portal . 
we need to face &apos; the other inconvenient truth . &apos; a global crisis in agriculture . 
great news . it drives me nuts that most people don &apos;t seem to know this news . 
well , let &apos;s first of all simplify the vases illusion , make the thing on the right . 
but luckily , my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest ! 
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a supermassive black hole there . 
and what you can see is it &apos;s very non-uniform . you see a lot more structure there . 
too many withdrawals from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shut down . 
now , the activities from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean . 
and i said , &quot; i have no training as a doctor . i never claimed that . &quot; 
so , you &apos;re putting in less juice , and therefore the outcome : fewer puzzles solved . 
but i brought along here a lump of coal -- right here , one lump of coal . 
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place . 
this is a laundry chute , and this right here is a shoe last . 
and when they produce their crops , they sell the surplus on marketplaces . 
worryingly , there is no consensus about what it is . 
it was 25 minutes of absolute terror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt . 
i don &apos;t understand why the media is focused on eastern pennsylvania . 
and this is an x-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel . 
all of us , to some extent , study this thing called a bill gates . 
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life . 
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars . 
reporter : israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd . 
and you &apos;ll see there is a line , a faint line going across that image . 
and i looked at it beneath the microscope . and some of it was flat . 
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish . 
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more . 
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways . 
it &apos;s unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed . 
this is a work , a library i designed for the robin hood foundation . 
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; fargo . &quot; 
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen . 
and so it is with archimedes , the great greek mathematician . 
i contacted a company in the states who make suits for nasa . 
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with chemotherapy today . 
if you think that way , you have a platonist moral framework . 
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are . 
but just looking up with the naked eye , you really don &apos;t need one . 
now not surprisingly , that influenced some people to think we were onto something . 
and this one , look how it slides sideways , every which way ? 
the chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries . 
so we updated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 . 
it was , incidentally , the last time i ever saw daylight . 
i believe that the political reforms are a must for china to maintain its growth . 
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely . 
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on . 
i &apos;d go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic . 
and so to me the question is not whether these dynamics will continue the way they have . 
in that hospice , there were 31 men and women who were actively dying . 
and there &apos;s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven &apos;t been mapped yet . 
that &apos;s a degree of an improvement that would look good on your report card , okay ? 
right , the current wants to run through the play-dough , not through that led . 
and everybody there agreed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital . 
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers . 
like if we had a piece of tape now , we &apos;d peel it this way . 
he &apos;s a tasmanian devil that we found with a large tumor on his face . 
in india , we had the naxalite movement , the &#91; unclear &#93; movement . 
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the collectors like . 
so let me end with just a few words about applications that we &apos;ve found for this . 
a public place so dismal that the winos don &apos;t even want to go there . 
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like . 
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct . 
but the problem isn &apos;t primarily that we &apos;re electing bad people to congress . 
the talk will be broadly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start . 
we have pre-cancerous lesions , which often don &apos;t turn into cancer . 
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ? 
there is no change in blood flow , in dilatation of the blood vessels . 
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zara store . it &apos;s three miles away . 
could we leverage these technologies to switch smartly whenever you travel from country to country ? 
now we have divergence over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area . 
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out . 
i think there is a socializing dimension in , kind of , moving that border . 
hulu and netflix , among other companies , have open vacation policies . 
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &apos;m full of doubt . 
i &apos;m going home for a midterm . a riot &apos;s going on on campus . 
if you go back two billion years , you &apos;re not on an earth-like planet any more . 
over time , those gas molecules dissolve into your blood and tissues and start to fill you up . 
so with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that i &apos;m working on now . 
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved . 
actually , i come from britain , but i &apos;ve been living in maldives for 26 years now . 
it was phenomenal , and we felt grateful that she trusted us to that extent . 
i &apos;m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule . 
i also need alcohol and morphine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;

and the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift . 
but if i come up really close and stare directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice crisp eyes . 
it &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spoken . everything has been said . 
it could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for . 
so arguing against , a man who &apos;s been at the nitty , gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years . 
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reveal this data anymore , so i had to make some estimates based on various sources . 
so they do this both when they have power sort of chronically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment . 
doctors back then were routinely telling men the importance of pleasuring their wives . 
and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out , that it &apos;s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion . 
and while it &apos;s true that ubuntu is an african idea , what i see is the essence of that value being invented here . 
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that . 
and i assure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists . 
there are people in the states right now tying themselves into knots , trying to figure out whether or not bloggers are journalists . 
maybe you &apos;re ticked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game . 
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a doorway appears from out of nowhere and it opens onto a staircase . 
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too . 
by now , we have now crawled another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew it , i knew it . 
but the group of daycare centers represented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bargain as of right now . 
we tended towards longer-term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies , which has just been great fun . 
but i would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task . 
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutrition , malnutrition out on the front lines . 
all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way , get our egotism out of the way . 
wk : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pump water and irrigation for crops . 
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shifts occurring around what china is doing in the democratic stance . 
stacy sager : but for christina sidebottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine . 
in the good old days when this republican ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right . 
and then she made me go up with the tape of it and prove that george abbott actually could talk . 
imagine , with somebody who &apos;s lost their whole arm , we still have four major nerves that go down your arm . 
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statistician . &quot; 
those exposed to the world war ii scenario made more interventionist recommendations than the others . 
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infection from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ? 
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; 
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in norway . 
so , these are three-pound charges of c4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes . 
so you have five million , that is , five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit . 
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hired to do , something like 25 years ago . 
we &apos;d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different . 
so i -- i took my camera , i took my notebook , took a chair , and started to observe this behavior . 
an architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox , and we now have the ability to use it . 
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hotels , and i &apos;m not married . &quot; 
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do , which have huge intention and huge opportunity . 
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth . 
what you see in this top drawing is a schematic of how petroleum gets used in the u.s. economy . 
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some difficulty ... 
many of them are working in deeply intractable systems -- the military , congress , the education system , etc . 
and he ended up achieving at a level that had never before been contemplated by any member of his family . 
so if it &apos;s a cell or a termite or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction . 
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ? 
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be celebrating that . 
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has virally swept around the world . 
they took longer to reject metaphors as false than they did to reject literally false sentences . 
and i started doing research , and we found , very excitingly , that the skin produces nitric oxide . 
and then we have stage 12 , which the textbooks call &quot; packaging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot; 
and let &apos;s face it , any new retrovirus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of . 
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils . 
all right , let me then finish off with four general statements , an example and two aphorisms . 
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was pregnant with him . 
as we stared scaling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ? 
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch . 
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies . 
and the reason the efficiencies are so low is these reactors operate at pretty low temperature . 
and this is the space probe cassini pirouetting through the ice rings of saturn . 
to this end , i have worked in sugar for stefan sagmeister , three-time ted speaker . 
the human goal here was to identify camps for relocation based on priority need . 
and she came into town and she rushed around and she said , &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot; 
it &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long distances that &apos;s very difficult to do . 
and together these volunteers and the teachers are deeply committed to creating a new generation of global , green leaders . 
it cost 1.7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by bernhardt , usa . 
to put it this way , nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist . 
when i go out to direct a film , every day we prepare too much , we think too much . 
but small atoms want to join together , small nuclei want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards iron . 
but you see democrats versus republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are . 
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day . 
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in burma . 
it &apos;s a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both . 
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ? 
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice . 
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like . 
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thrice . 
so the first one -- the most famous appointment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour . 
now , there &apos;s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary logic . 
it tastes great within the borders of that country , but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else . 
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs . 
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous beak in action . 
the women &apos;s chief of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dirty . 
&quot; be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said mahatma gandhi . 
we &apos;ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work . 
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively climbs by slipping and look -- and doing , actually , terribly , with respect to grabbing on the surface . 
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circuit . &quot; 
but curiously , redwood rainforests , the fragments that we have left , to this day remain under-explored . 
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called hans jenny in the 1970s . 
but he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century . 
it felt like we were kind of laying these underground cables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come . 
it provides a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes . 
now i have to tell you , i was talking to kyle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story . 
and then , the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles . 
and i thought it was astonishing to speculate , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wound . 
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspectives at the earliest stage . 
and the great irony and tragedy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that . 
so your house is dealing with leaks all the time , but it &apos;s fixing them . it &apos;s draining them out and so on . 
we pump the fluid through one of these systems , and we press the button , and it &apos;s analyzed for the genomic character . 
and i was like , &quot; all we need is alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again . &quot; 
&quot; you can call it a dinosaur , but look at the velociraptor : the velociraptor is cool . &quot; 
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i quit the media lab . 
so what we found was , when tryptophan was low , people were more likely to take revenge when they &apos;re treated unfairly . 
and you can see this looks a bit like a chef &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an assault , the one in blue . 
so we are right now doing some systematic field tests to basically ascertain whether something like this actually makes sense to the asha worker . 
on the one hand , he wants to satisfy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking . 
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the glories of human existence . 
so i would encourage you all to grab some play-doh , grab some salt , grab some sugar and start playing . 
we have dawn orbiting vesta , and we have over here new horizons on a straight shot to pluto . 
thankfully , i was able to answer a , and i say that honestly in case my life insurance agent is listening . 
so what you see here is a subtraction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer . 
and i was on the cusp of , sort of , adolescence , so i was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking . 
licklider foresaw computers doing all the routinizable work that was required to prepare the way for insights and decision making . 
so , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work . 
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time . 
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and mourning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies . 
it was ridiculous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn &apos;t travel with me . 
these things that i photographed -- this tire pile here had 45 million tires in it . it was the largest one . 
solving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , renewable energy . 
biomimicry , which is something that is an emerging science , winds up being a very important social justice idea . 
this is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you &apos;ve made love to them . 
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : calcium carbonate , calcium carbonate . 
sent to prison , adamantly insisting on his innocence , which he has consistently for 21 years . 
there was this equation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spiritual . 
and she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school . 
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot; 
it &apos;s acoustic vibrations in the air , little waves of energy in the air that tickle our eardrum . 
those are then selected by the algorithm , reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well . 
or you could play many games in one small patch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in . 
even if they did their jobs , and they cited those facilities for their violations , the fine would be derisory . 
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reserves , is that the funding models have been wrong . 
we now know that at gombe alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes . 
bj : so , as dereck says , we have to work through extremes -- extreme temperatures , push ourselves at night . 
and all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the epa . 
somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to premature twins . 
in terms of where we are in science with dna identification capacities and so on , it &apos;s not that far off . 
it &apos;s in notting hill next to all the crap -- you know , the prostitutes and all that stuff . 
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of efforts to find out where the money in deals like this went . 
the leader of the chiefs said , &quot; no , sorry . we can &apos;t take you . you &apos;ll slow us down . 
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you . 
but that subdivides christianity , islam and buddhism into many subgroups , which was too detailed . 
it &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure . 
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; scattering of x-rays on the teeth , the metal in the teeth . 
however , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; right ! how can i clap ? ok , maybe ... 
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long . 
a handy thing to have , because language is infinite , and you can &apos;t just parrot back the sentences that you &apos;ve heard . 
treatment programs became possible , funding became available , and the number of people on antiretroviral drugs started to increase very rapidly . 
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the close-up . and see if you can see it land . 
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a slave to take care of me . 
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine . 
let &apos;s take a look at it again . watch the coloration : white on the right , brown on the left . 
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals . 
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet . 
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers like breast , prostate and colon cancer . 
lyn : when i &apos;m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane .

when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toilet that doesn &apos;t flush . &quot; 
the passengers who fell off the titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade . 
after these genomes are synthesized , the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome . 
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ? 
and when we think about legacy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was . 
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the vector and increase the time . 
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 300,000 people in tamil nadu , india . 
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there &apos;s major inefficiencies , energy consumption and excessive labor techniques . 
the abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nano-structured . 
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to . 
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the kings and queens of kenya or britain . 
when people don &apos;t take their pills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems . 
so as i spent time with leaders in the gnh movement , i got to really understand what they &apos;re doing . 
so , again , we were asked to design a water pump for a company called approtec , in kenya . 
look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us . she scared us with the lava man . 
it &apos;s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , messy diapers .

john is one of &#91; about &#93; a dozen very heroic , courageous people who volunteered for the study . 
endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this . 
the rule is about a 10-year delay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all . 
i showed a norman rockwell painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly . 
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served , which is over 50,000 people . 
many of these deaths were completely preventable , and this what i want to think of as the disconcerting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem . 
it might well be that there are environmental factors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic factors we &apos;re not aware of . 
i think there &apos;s a kind of metaphysical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions . 
and if i want to start having children by the time i &apos;m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago . 
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began imitating , there was a new copying process . 
it &apos;s a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs . 
and the last material i &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my toaster had to have a plastic case . 
and even though i &apos;ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreciate that mannahatta was a very special place . 
and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap . 
now it &apos;s largely processed and full of all sorts of additives , extra ingredients , and you know the rest of the story . 
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very solid , steady , upward path , right from beginning to end . 
and had such -- it was an eye-opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science . 
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease . 
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is released -- the uprising begins in the streets of tehran .

and this was collected by anapum -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will evaporate . 
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bacchanal by titian . &quot; 
and so the backstory of the 99 takes place in 1258 , which history tells us the mongols invaded baghdad and destroyed it . 
this is a helicopter medic giving cpr to a soldier who had been shot in the head . 
we managed , but sometimes those halls didn &apos;t seem exactly suited to the music i was making or had made . 
so , this session &apos;s supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour &apos;s really partly about meaning . 
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city . 
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?

u.n. opened their statistic databases , and we have a new version of the software up working as a beta on the net , so you don &apos;t have to download it any longer . 
what &apos;s also happening in shanghai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a holdout . 
so this triptych , these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay . 
it had become a part of my body , an extension of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my official image . 
they downloaded it from disney.com , or one of these websites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village . 
this is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the united states . 
but when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot; 
so &quot; thank you &quot; feel likes a really trite word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life . 
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bulbs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 125 light bulbs &apos; worth . 
when it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency . 
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big chunks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black . 
lp : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands . 
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work . 
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demonstrated in washington . can we look at this thing ? 
these foreign fighters had left their families in the gulf , the levant and north africa to join al qaeda in iraq . 
you don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with . 
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , viewed through a sort of a bluish medium . 
2005 i did a base jump from the eiger , from the monk and from the jungfrau , three very famous mountains in switzerland . 
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a storyteller . &quot; 
a lion having a late night snack -- notice he &apos;s got a broken tooth . 
so , now , what i want to do : i &apos;m going to put the middle nine surfaces here under yellow illumination by simply putting a filter behind them . 
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy . 
but this is the unit of currency that we &apos;ve taught our monkeys at yale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food . 
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology incubator , and we had eight startups sitting around there . 
and , of course , we &apos;re not responsible for the consequences of what we &apos;re doing now , are we ? like all this complaint about clones . 
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity . 
here is a pest , devastating pest , a spider mite , because it does a lot of webbing like a spider . 
when food is scarce , they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver . 
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we aiming at . 
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is mediated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time . 
how many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ? 
but i get a lot of toilets , and so you just dispatch a toilet with a hammer , and then you have lumpy tiles . 
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy , you would think that girls &apos; games were kinda sissy . 
in fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies . 
there &apos;s another sign that we need pit crews , and that &apos;s the unmanageable cost of our care . 
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i urge you to join me . 
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bribes every year , or equal to india &apos;s gdp . 
i came here to speak about ecology , and i emitted as much co2 as a frenchman in one year . 
i started laughing because it got to the point where , was i a writer , or was i a homeless woman ? 
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in mexico . 
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes goliath to react to the sight of david . 
in order to access these sub-surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this . 
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work . 
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e. lee , john buford at gettysburg . 
so what you see here is 12 separate petals , that each could be controlled with individual microprocessors that would only cost a dollar . 
the only exception is the naked somalian mole-rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground . 
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as potent as it has always been , if only designers could look within . 
and they also are able to show and to exhibit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .

so it acts as a screen to protect the rail and the commuter , and not to have objects falling on the rails . 
three compost bins -- go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic compost . 
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nurtured by the people around them .

so , now we have , immediately , a real-time map showing where there are refugee camps -- rapidly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing relief work in port-au-prince . 
and what was so gorgeous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter higgs and his team considered one of the deepest of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ? 
so like fox mulder on &quot; x-files , &quot; who wants to believe in ufos ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .

we are the only ones who actually returned the award for $ 50,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually casting aspersions on the barefoot architects of tilonia . 
these are some designs from eric drexler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are feasible with super-computing simulations , where actually there are scientists building molecule-scale robots . 
there &apos;s a thing that happens when you mold and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size . 
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this .

one of them also being , although logically it &apos;s quite a good idea to have a lift with no up and down button in it , if it only serves two floors , it &apos;s actually bloody terrifying , okay ? 
now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that &apos;s 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 .

so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bottom-up construction approaches for architecture , which contrast the current , victorian , top-down methods which impose structure upon matter .

now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this chemostatted ocean , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or adapt to this rapid acidification that &apos;s going on right now . 
the reptilian part of our brain , which sits in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s threatened , it shuts down everything else , it shuts down the prefrontal cortex , the parts which learn , it shuts all of that down .

beneath that , i &apos;ll put a two-by-two square , and next to that , a three-by-three square , beneath that , a five-by-five square , and then an eight-by-eight square , creating one giant rectangle , right ? 
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability . 
likewise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert . 
well , this has deep implications about the limits of science , about predictability and controllability of things like biological processes or economies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology . 
i was walking through el dorado -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or infamous prison -- in venezuela , and i don &apos;t know what possessed me , because this was not like me .

come with me to the bottom of the world , antarctica , the highest , driest , windiest , and yes , coldest region on earth -- more arid than the sahara and , in parts , colder than mars . 
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue , myod acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skeletal muscle cells ?

and there are certain obligations that should go with those benefits to be placed on the operators , and the key one is , of course , that the operators pay for everything , including all the interfacing into the public sector . 
now , 18 years later , i &apos;m proud to tell you , last year we fed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the holidays : thanksgiving , christmas -- -- in all the different countries around the world . 
the future entertainment media that we &apos;re going to see is going to be very data-driven , and it &apos;s going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action . 
i also learned , don &apos;t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more . 
which brings on another threshold effect i like to call furnace dumping , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be heated with a furnace , you save a whole bunch of money up front . 
so it took me from places like chile -- the atacama desert in chile -- to siberia , to underground mines in the japanese alps , in northern america , all the way to antarctica and even to the south pole . 
the key though in all of these , the red thread , is the shift in mindset , moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead backcast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ? 
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front desk and the guy at the front desk said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor tonight , so if you want to put the kids five floors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot; 
basically i &apos;m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore . 
in a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff . marketing guru seth godin spells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones . 
now , sylvia &apos;s ted prize wish was to beseech us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set aside not pin pricks , but significant expanses of the ocean for preservation , &quot; hope spots , &quot; she calls them . 
but are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ? 
i was leaving a seminar when it started , humming to myself , fumbling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice calmly observe , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot; 
jean vanier says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , beloved , late friend mother teresa -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &apos;s in the first instance about changing ourselves . 
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &apos;s palpable in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &apos;m really hoping that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect . 
we realized that when plastics get to the dump , it &apos;s difficult to sort them because they have similar densities , and when they &apos;re mixed with organic matter and construction debris , it &apos;s truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them . 
if you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ; it &apos;s made up of a collage , a patchwork , of regions of different colors and luminances . 
we live in an age where some of the great breakthroughs are not going to happen in the labs or the halls of academia but on laptops , desktops , in the palms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search . 
you see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies . 
it may be that the social singularity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a convergence of catastrophes , of environmental degradation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pandemics , of poverty . 
we &apos;ve flown the cassini spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these jets , into the denser regions of these jets , so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements . 
because she fell in love with walter raleigh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then walter raleigh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ... 
in &quot; upwake &quot; buildings wear suits , zero tap dances on a giant keyboard , clones himself with a scanner , tames and whips the computer mice , sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space . 
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science literature that you can now take a skin cell and encourage it to become a liver cell or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us . 
biologist mark pagel shares an intriguing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tribes to access a powerful new tool : cooperation . 
these are the people who are doing the bulk of the site , and they are , in a sense , semi-professionals at what they &apos;re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality . 
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , search-wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries . 
so , dad graduated harvard in 1946 , married my mom , and bought a house in lexington , massachusetts , where the first shots were fired against the british in 1775 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until concord . 
thus , even though every civilian killed , maimed , raped , or tortured is one too many , the fact that the number of civilian casualties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news . 
the more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists to actually look at the monkeys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically matched , not just qualitatively , but quantitatively with what we saw humans doing in a real market . 
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- vanity , pleasure -- produced links , and tied to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up . 
i mean , you &apos;d think this is the result of some tabletop experiment , but this is the result of worldwide chaotic behavior -- countries accusing each other of dumping products , ipos , bankruptcies , marketing programs . 
then , the idea is that wolfram alpha will be able to figure out what precise pieces of code can do what they &apos;re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , precise programs . 
and then the compost is all taken back to the roofs of the city , where we &apos;ve got farming , because what we &apos;ve done is lifted up the city , the landscape , into the air to -- to restore the native landscape on the roofs of the buildings . 
he was bobby kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist , as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way . 
and it goes all the way over to these big , thick , galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons , and they have thousands of hydrogens , and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them . 
al jazeera brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , exposed the hypocrisy of osama bin laden and al qaeda , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclusions . 
when we actually looked at not just self-reported political orientation , but voting behavior , we were able to look geographically across the nation . what we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity , mccain got more votes . 
so as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world . 
the more that robots ingrain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &apos;re forced to examine ourselves as people . at tedxberkeley , ken goldberg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working with robots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-pound package of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the postal office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-pound packages of bees . 
animal fan nellie mckay sings a sparkling tribute to her dear dog . she suggests we all do the same : &quot; just go right to the pound / and find yourself a hound / and make that doggie proud / &apos; cause that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot; 
and when i was applying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my aunt who survived years of beatings at the hand of her husband and escaped a marriage of abuse with only her dignity intact . 
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of miracle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is treating us as averages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the guesswork . 
the culmination of this is if you &apos;ve successfully raised your tadpole , observing the behavioral and developmental events , you will then go and introduce your tadpole to its namesake and discuss the evidence that you &apos;ve seen . 
now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low odds , so i personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all . 
you know that when you have those abusive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape , you might have yourself depression . 
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed , you know , that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit , you know , same color as the buick . 
i put it to you today that it is this system that is embodied by china that is gathering momentum amongst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fastest improvements in living standards in the shortest period of time . 
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a hook to science , because seti involves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronomy , but also geology , also chemistry , various scientific disciplines all can be presented in the guise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e.t. &quot; 
well birds are pretty hard-wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supplement it , part of ben &apos;s idea is to use homing pigeons to help train the young passenger pigeons how to flock and how to find their way to their old nesting grounds and feeding grounds . 
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder , next to one student , concentrated attention , shining this beam of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-expression , is going to be absolutely transformative , because so many of the students have not had that ever before . 
children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in ghana , reunited with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villages to rebuild their economic well-being so that they become slave-proof -- absolutely unenslaveable . 
and he rushed home . and after the sabbath , he made 12 loaves of bread , took them to the synagogue , went into the synagogue , opened the ark and said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &quot; 
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful sparkling thing , with the disk slowly rotating , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imaginative way , so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time . 
so , once you have mobility , now you &apos;re making a lot of engines because you &apos;ve got lots of units , as opposed to steam ships or big factories where you &apos;re not making as many units , so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production where all the other engines didn &apos;t benefit . 
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the dawning of the universe and what i call the cosmic scene investigation , that is , looking at the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it . 
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h20 , water . 
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that slippery slope to that dangerous , scary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consciously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it . 
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy . 
and he remained there until 1.6 million years later , when this very famous fossil hunter , kamoya kimeu , walked along a small hillside and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface amongst the pebbles , recognized it as being hominid . 
the green areas here show where corn yields , just showing corn as an example , are already really high , probably the maximum you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield you should be able to get . 
now , instead of doing it like misdirection and throwing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security guard , and get you , instead of focusing on your external senses , just to go internal for a second . 
more recently , that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant proportion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing supercomputers linked at speeds greater than what we consider to be broadband today . 
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with penny patterson and koko , with sue savage-rumbaugh and kanzi , panbanisha , irene pepperberg , alex the parrot , i got all excited . 
our municipalities , rural and urban , play the operational course of infrastructure -- things like waste disposal , energy demand , as well as social costs of unemployment , drop-out rates , incarceration rates and the impacts of various public health costs . 
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-tech composites our future will be made of . 
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a brew -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 . 
the service providers , well , for the first time , they &apos;ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &apos;re doing in a really constructive way and learn and demonstrate the value of what they &apos;re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment . 
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn &apos;t have foreseen that i would go from pursuing my dream in politics and working at a desk to tripping over a shadow and then turning people into paintings and painting on people in a pool of milk . 
this is another version of that . this is a sea dragon , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a juvenile that has not yet swallowed the acid , has not yet taken in the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy . 
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in interacting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely strip it of all its complicating features , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simplified object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early stages , embryonic stages of new insights into what happens in two brains while they simultaneously interact . 
the thing to watch for as a global philanthropy industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the aspiration is to flip these old assumptions , for philanthropy to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term . 
there &apos;s been an explosion of collaborative consumption -- web-powered sharing of cars , apartments , skills . rachel botsman explores the currency that makes systems like airbnb and taskrabbit work : trust , influence , and what she calls &quot; reputation capital . &quot; 
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly seamlessly integrates the two-dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in . 
so to invoke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabric of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you to her , on out endlessly into the distance -- this fabric is actually like an old-fashioned american quilt , and it has patches on it : happy and unhappy patches . 
we were freaks -- lobster claw boys and bearded ladies , oddities juggling depression and loneliness , playing solitaire , spin the bottle , trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal , but at night , while the others slept , we kept walking the tightrope . 
so this is called stilting . it &apos;s a thermal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a towel , somebody has this towel -- &quot; sorry , i &apos;ve jumped onto your towel . &quot; -- and then you scuttle across onto somebody else &apos;s towel , and that way you don &apos;t burn your feet . 
a congolese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her raped in front of them and mutilated in front of them , and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now . 
they &apos;d given me a large grant when i was an academician for the study of felony drunken drivers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious . 
imagine a country with abundant power -- oil and gas , sunshine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fahad al-attiya talks about the unexpected ways that the small middle eastern nation of qatar creates its water supply . 
so here we were , a nuclear physicist , an internist , soon joined by carrie hruska , a biomedical engineer , and two radiologists , and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape . 
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaningful . 
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offensive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to doodle officially means to dawdle , to dilly dally , to monkey around , to make meaningless marks , to do something of little value , substance or import , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing . 
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery -- encouraging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stranger , in the face of the vibrant religious other . 
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , astrazeneca , general electric , philips , have already answered in the affirmative the question that from their bangalore and hyderabad r &amp; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world . 
during the twentieth century , we witnessed the atrocities of stalin , hitler , mao , pol pot , rwanda and other genocides , and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old , we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in darfur and the daily horrors of iraq . 
and then the third thing would be , please show me a sheaf of texts written by 16-year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ideally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could examine this linguistic miracle happening right under our noses . 
he records a song called &quot; blind willie mctell , &quot; named after the blues singer , and the song is a voyage through the past , through a much darker time , but a simpler one , a time when musicians like willie mctell had few illusions about what they did . 
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , toxins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the preparation of information , i &apos;ve looked at from the viewpoint of food . 
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural , industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world , seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience . 
and into the slow , second movement , marked &quot; adagio religioso , &quot; he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part . 
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of short-term workforce to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pipeline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clinic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs . 
right ? so , when institutions are told they are obstacles , and that there are other ways of coordinating the value , they go through something a little bit like the kubler-ross stages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a fatal illness : denial , anger , bargaining , acceptance . 
but i think this research shows that the british enlightenment , or the scottish enlightenment , with david hume , adam smith , actually had a better handle on who we are -- that reason is often weak , our sentiments are strong , and our sentiments are often trustworthy . 
what dr. soljacic figured out how to do was separate the coils in a transformer to a greater distance than the size of those transformers using this technology , which is not dissimilar from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room . 
if we &apos;d evolved in a vacuum , we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously . if we were bacteria , constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle worlders are too big to notice brownian motion . 
technology in x-ray where it &apos;s life-size processed , apart from these large cargo-scanning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big . 
interestingly enough , other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases , not just alzheimer &apos;s disease . 
so , if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape , and augment it with information that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles . 
it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of processing to convert that image that we just took into a sort of digital fingerprint , and the great thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much identical to what we &apos;ve just used to create this demonstration . 
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &apos;s a personal relationship to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform . 
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extremes of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail . 
&quot; the human voice : mysterious , spontaneous , primal . &quot; with these words , soprano claron mcfadden invites us to explore the mysteries of breathing and singing , as she performs the challenging &quot; aria , &quot; by john cage . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
the master said , &apos; thou didst thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , i coined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable . 
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are . 
in this case , instead of throwing chewing gum , or doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish -- there &apos;s a body of water in iceland that i &apos;ve been dealing with that &apos;s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution burden on it is not the roadborne pollution , it &apos;s actually white bread from people feeding the fish and the birds . 
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation , the uv and the x-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation . 
and i decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction . 
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by shearing winds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer differ significantly , and in the middle , in between , you get this undulating of the air , and if the difference in those speeds is just right , the tops of the undulations curl over in these beautiful breaking wave-like vortices . 
i &apos;ve always been attracted to those rare people who pull that off , who devote their lives to humanity with the grit of the warrior and the grace of the mystic -- people like martin luther king , jr . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be . 
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our cad / cams and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about thermal properties , know about design , know about atmospheric interaction , parachutes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent , so to see , does that meet the requirement that we need . 
these drugs were brought to market . they were prescribed very widely because heart attacks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increased rate of death that before we detected that safety signal , over 100,000 people died unnecessarily in america from the prescription of anti-arrhythmic drugs . 
i &apos;d basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy , which i won &apos;t get into here , because it &apos;s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &apos;s about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s unfortunate that i don &apos;t have more time . 
so since we can make some interesting protocells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos;re very easy to make , and they have interesting lifelike properties , perhaps these protocells have something to tell us about the origin of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily accessible step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth . 
i &apos;m a little bit of an amateur historian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earliest quote that i could find was one from david livingstone , writing in the 1850s about how the railroad , the steam ship , and the telegraph were integrating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world . 
this is used in reference to a report in 2007 by the national research council in the united states , wherein they tried to understand how we can look for life elsewhere in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ? 
and some are quite structural , like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are . 
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hire captain kirk and spock to do the job ; after all , they were very proficient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot; 
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bolivian edge of the amazon , here also in 1975 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of seam , and there &apos;s a lone farmer out there in the middle of the primeval jungle . 
venice is sinking . to save it , rachel armstrong says we need to outgrow architecture made of inert materials and , well , make architecture that grows itself . she proposes a not-quite-alive material that does its own repairs and sequesters carbon , too . 
but i will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did . so , first , we violate the common sense , the logic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you . 
we believe that in a one-hour flight we can rewrite the textbook on mars by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere , looking for gases of biogenic origin , looking for gases of volcanic origin , studying the surface , studying the magnetism on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a dozen other areas . 
it &apos;s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fills my entire life . 
right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool , i take off from wisconsin and move to kansas , small town kansas , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lovely , small-town , rural kansas school district , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government . 
because if they toxify themselves , being the lowest-cost producer , send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- wal-mart -- and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mutually assured destruction . 
sam harris : yeah , well i think i tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : what is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ? 
so , if we want to track something that was spreading through a network , what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors on the central individuals within the network , including node a , monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early detection of whatever it is that is spreading through the network . 
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing , as you can tell from the price of opera tickets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical titles released , the number of new albums and so on . 
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-oil . 
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ? 
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizarre , wonderful animals , or you want to build a search-and-rescue robot that can help you in an earthquake , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preserve nature &apos;s designs . 
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotionally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from proving that the product they produced was at the world-quality level needed to make coartem , when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history . 
it &apos;s something that i &apos;ve worked on and a few other people , and it indicates a kind of hierarchy along with some assumptions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected a very different theory , a much more popular one , and an older one , due largely to john nash of &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; fame , is what &apos;s called equilibrium analysis . 
and to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know . 
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differentiates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual merit to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as functional as we can and as freely interconnectable as we can ? 
and as soon as they had laid all these , all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india , he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes . 
fortunately , necessity remains the mother of invention , and a lot of the design work that we &apos;re the most proud of with the aircraft came out of solving the unique problems of operating it on the ground -- everything from a continuously-variable transmission and liquid-based cooling system that allows us to use an aircraft engine in stop-and-go traffic , to a custom-designed gearbox that powers either the propeller when you &apos;re flying or the wheels on the ground , to the automated wing-folding mechanism that we &apos;ll see in a moment , to crash safety features . 
i &apos;ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &apos;t come out -- that what i &apos;m concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population curve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than doubles and we &apos;re up three-and-a-half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be added than existed on earth when i was born . 
th : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and appropriate for me to be here at tedwomen is that , well , i think it was summed up best last night at dinner when someone said , &quot; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &apos; when the revolution starts , we &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with rachel carson &apos;s &quot; silent spring &quot; to theo colborn &apos;s &quot; our stolen future &quot; to sandra steingraber &apos;s books &quot; living downstream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot; 
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform flavors that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a carrot cake , put it in a blender , and we have kind of like a carrot cake juice , and then that went into a balloon frozen in liquid nitrogen to create this hollow shell of carrot cake ice cream , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , jupiter &apos;s floating around your plate . 
the fuel , like i said , is ceramic inside zirconium fuel rods , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of reactors , fukushima and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while — but these zirconium claddings on these fuel rods , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , steam , in an oxidizing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydrogen , and that hydrogen has this explosive capability to release fission products . 
one of the ironies of this whole system is we &apos;re discussing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assumption , and one of the best guesses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absorb sunlight , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black rivers . 
now , i was taken by inspector brian cantera , of the royal canadian mounted police , to a cavernous warehouse east of vancouver to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated by the rcmp from the smugglers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an insatiable market for b.c. bud , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s marketed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california . 
now , i was raised in the pacific northwest , around a lot of church of latter-day saints people and , you know , i &apos;ve worked with them and even dated them , but i never really knew the doctrine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &quot; well , please , come in . &quot; and they looked really happy , because i don &apos;t think this happens to them all that often . 
so with that , i &apos;d like to say a few words about upgrading , and share with you a glimpse from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self-learning , learning by doing , self-exploration and community-building , and this project deals with k-12 math education , beginning with early age math , and we do it on tablets because we believe that math , like anything else , should be taught hands on . 
i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized , you know , the big story from amsterdam isn &apos;t what &apos;s in the design stores , it &apos;s what &apos;s out on the streets , and maybe it &apos;s self-explanatory , but a city that hasn &apos;t been taken over by modernism , that &apos;s preserved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected . 
so they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the united states senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to ratify that treaty . whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say . 
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test flame-retardant pajamas in an inferno to ensure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reaches across the stove , so these stories of families negotiating these extreme differences reflect on the universal experience of parenting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ? 
myth number two : orpheus , wonderful guy , charming to be around , great partier , great singer , loses his beloved , charms his way into the underworld , only person to charm his way into the underworld , charms the gods of the underworld , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out . 
this is a paper form , and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a ministry of health nurse in indonesia who is tramping out across the countryside in indonesia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and humid day , and she is going to be knocking on thousands of doors over a period of weeks or months , knocking on the doors and saying , &quot; excuse me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions . 
finally , in about the sixteenth century , a physician whose name was theophrastus bombastus aureolus von hohenheim , called paracelsus , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old paracelsus found that he could predict the degree of convulsion by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion . 
the days are past when a person , company or brand could tightly control their reputation -- online chatter and spin mean that if you &apos;re relevant , there &apos;s a constant , free-form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim leberecht offers three big ideas about accepting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an impetus to recommit to your values . 
the third thing on my checklist is relations with neighboring friendly societies that may prop up a society . and if that friendly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the greenland norse , they had trade with the mother country -- norway -- and that trade dwindled : partly because norway got weaker , partly because of sea ice between greenland and norway . 
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapidly and orderly , actually the school system is recognizably an inheritance from the 19th century , from a bismarkian model of german schooling that got taken up by english reformers , and often by religious missionaries , taken up in the united states as a force of social cohesion , and then in japan and south korea as they developed . 
the tuna team from topp has done the unthinkable : three teams tagged 1,700 tunas , bluefin , yellowfin and albacore all at the same time -- carefully rehearsed tagging programs in which we go out , pick up juvenile tunas , put in the tags that actually have the sensors , stick out the tuna and then let them go . 
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp rory stewart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democracies are deeply corrupt ; meanwhile , 84 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , stewart sounds a call to action to rebuild democracy , starting with recognizing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ideal . 
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different climatic parameters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable outdoor conditions , to change our thermal perception that we feel comfortable in an outdoor environment , and we can do that with the best passive design , but also using the energy source of the site in qatar which is the sun . 
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &apos;s see if we can come up with some really clever incentives so that , even if the people we deal with don &apos;t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic incentives that will get people to do the right thing even out of pure selfishness . 
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat . 
and i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a statement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large masses of things , and when you -- in monoculture , and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that &apos;s important to us . 
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guaranteed income is going to stifle our drive to succeed and make us kind of complacent , you might be interested to know that social mobility , one of the things we really pride ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very generous social safety nets . 
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized . not that it &apos;s become less capital intensive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s required -- but that the ownership of this capital , the way the capitalization happens , is radically distributed . each of us , in these advanced economies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer . 
i don &apos;t know if you know this but -- maybe it &apos;s different now , or maybe you were making a statement -- but in many hospital nurseries across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by jessica benjamin , the signs over the little boys cribs read , &quot; i &apos;m a boy , &quot; and the signs over the little girls cribs read , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . &quot; yeah . 
we launched two titles in october -- &quot; rockett &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rockett beginning her first day of school in eighth grade at a brand new place , with a blank slate , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot; 
and my favorite example of that occurred beginning in 1976 , when it was discovered that the bacteria causing legionnaires disease had always been present in natural waters , but it was the precise temperature of the water in heating , ventilating and air conditioning systems that raised the right temperature for the maximum reproduction of legionella bacillus . 
but if we could move charitable giving from two percent of gdp up just one step to three percent of gdp , by investing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contributions , and if that money could go disproportionately to health and human services charities , because those were the ones we encouraged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tripling of contributions to that sector . 
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it &apos;s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they &apos;re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct . 
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to remain globally influential , they may have to consider cooperating in the short term in order to compete , and by that , they might have to focus more aggressively on economic outcomes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accountable and create the democracies that we really want .
