it &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then deli@@ vered to me .
i can pe@@ el off the layer of the li@@ on .
wonderful engine .
that &apos;s the pan@@ the@@ on next to it .
this is called &quot; the cap@@ tain &apos;s hat story . &quot;
that &apos;s just one benefit of that .
but it was not to be that simple .
what can we do together that benefits us both ?
david gri@@ ff@@ in : how photograph@@ y conne@@ cts us
they become aware . they achieve autonom@@ y .
free@@ ways .
i sei@@ ze comm@@ and by physical pro@@ w@@ ess , and i keep it by be@@ ating my ch@@ est , and you make sub@@ mis@@ sive gest@@ ures .
so ideas change states .
as we know , only half the states have op@@ ted in .
in ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as they don &apos;t even ask . &quot;
in this case , we put two chimpanze@@ es si@@ de-@@ b@@ y-@@ side .
i almost miss it .
and i was sitting side by side with one of our very coura@@ ge@@ ous law@@ yers , and said , &quot; how can we get this out ? how can we make sure that this is imple@@ mented ?
but that moved me .
we go on blind dat@@ es .
but it was only the beginning .
&quot; my sister and i used to sing in cho@@ irs together constantly .
and bees are very fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful .
it &apos;s easy to b@@ end .
so given that that &apos;s true , how good are we at increasing our happiness ?
you know what ? here &apos;s a little secret .
we did it in three steps .
voice : don &apos;t tell , or it won &apos;t come true .
and then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
so that &apos;s sort of what we expect .
no doctor , can i remember , ever asking me , &quot; where have you lived ? &quot;
the things i can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
so , if that &apos;s right , why did we only capture four out of those 15@@ 1 minds ?
because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very ti@@ red . &quot;
and of course , there &apos;s an ap@@ p for that .
there is one more decision .
you must be out of your mind . &quot;
and this is he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .
you &apos;re happy .
this next decade is the decade of games .
explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
but let &apos;s play along .
yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
paul worked for years on the c@@ amer@@ o@@ oni@@ an national radio and television , and he spoke about health issues . he was a health cor@@ respon@@ dent .
it became part of me .
la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y is doing this kind of surgery : surgery with long instru@@ ments through small in@@ c@@ isi@@ ons .
we had plans .
it can was@@ h the s@@ lu@@ dge off high mountain pe@@ a@@ ks and h@@ ills , down into the lo@@ w@@ lands . so stop and think for a minute .
move it .
how long will it take it to fill it up ?
my mother was , sort of , very sensitive to his mother , who it seemed was a little bit skep@@ tical about the whole alternative lifest@@ yle thing .
they &apos;re also fairly weal@@ thy and aff@@ lu@@ ent and all these other sorts of things .
so we said , &quot; okay , give us a reward and give us a pun@@ ish@@ ment . okay ? &quot;
it was all these things .
and , i say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is enti@@ t@@ led to make that choice .
went up to the floor , the second floor , and said : &quot; hey , guys .
i mean , couldn &apos;t you have used the virg@@ in brand for that as well ?
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
because the roots of the plant are not very effective .
but still , we look at the pieces .
i &apos;m built to last .
and what he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s pas@@ sing a small magnetic pul@@ se through the sk@@ ul@@ l of the partici@@ p@@ ant in our study into their in@@ fer@@ ior fron@@ tal gy@@ rus .
the answer is what i call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
and i looked at it underneath the microscop@@ e .
they generally seem to think , &quot; well , why would we care what &apos;s happened with the police ?
we call ourselves por@@ s and ra@@ o , and we live and work in india .
it &apos;s the same theory of gravity .
that &apos;s what you get fu@@ ri@@ ous about right ?
i wo@@ und up on every television show .
people are watching us all around , &quot; right ?
that &apos;s the current business model .
the media has covered this some@@ what exten@@ si@@ vely .
every school succe@@ e@@ ds .
they bel@@ on@@ ged to boys .
but nobody actually demon@@ strated it , right ?
we get to write the scri@@ pt of the next revolution in surgery .
therefore , they asked their parents to go down to the streets and collect them , bring them back home .
it would change his day , all right ?
and i say to tony , &quot; let &apos;s do this . &quot;
we must change everything .
a photo is not enough . &quot;
and one day , we went for a meeting .
here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
but the pa@@ y-@@ off is really enormous .
and i &apos;d pull her out on the front por@@ ch .
you and your kids are fine .
i actually love di@@ ving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the da@@ y@@ time .
because now , to make this twice as difficult , we &apos;ll ju@@ g@@ gle the seven clu@@ bs back ...
technology is transforma@@ tional .
so you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
so we started giving back .
it comes back to instin@@ ct .
so for the sub@@ way in new york , i saw a cor@@ respon@@ dence between ri@@ ding the sub@@ way and reading .
we were very successful .
everybody knew the answer .
in mother &apos;s milk .
there &apos;s just one problem .
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
there &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
now i think it &apos;s too easy .
and they say to me , &quot; stop com@@ pla@@ ining . &quot;
everybody &apos;s wel@@ come .
it &apos;s been a good ride .
actually it was a very hard challenge .
and of course , it turns into a circle .
they were actually attac@@ king them .
so the key here is empathy .
i was born in new york city .
and you need to re-@@ set it up .
and the mathemati@@ cians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two pro@@ gressi@@ ons as a fir@@ st-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation and a secon@@ d-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation , der@@ i@@ ved by si@@ x-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .

and it &apos;s terri@@ bly en@@ danger@@ ed .
who are these characters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
this is considered the five bl@@ ess@@ ings .
you read about it in your new@@ spa@@ pers .
which i think is just fascinating .
so to make the experiment , i knew i &apos;d have to go into the brain and manipu@@ late oxyto@@ cin directly .
and that was really cool .
i was born in al@@ geria .
how does it feel to see someone like this come along taking your art and doing so much with it ?
here &apos;s some numbers .
and i started to bring some order into some fla@@ gs .
and so you see beings in their potential happiness .
that would be bad for econom@@ ies and cities .
and they fe@@ ature as their role models really great sal@@ es@@ men .
in this so@@ aring demon@@ stration , dea@@ f per@@ c@@ us@@ sion@@ ist ev@@ el@@ yn gl@@ en@@ nie illu@@ str@@ ates how listening to music invol@@ ves much more than simply le@@ tting sound waves hit your ear@@ dru@@ ms .

and now all be@@ ts are off .
in this funny and insi@@ ght@@ ful talk , buil@@ der dan phil@@ li@@ ps t@@ ours us through a do@@ zen homes he &apos;s built in texas using recycl@@ ed and rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed materials in wil@@ dly creative ways . brilliant , low-@@ tech design details will re@@ fresh your own creative drive . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

this is where we stand today .
there has to be something better . &quot;
and it been growing for about 600 years .
so you start with the bag@@ asse , and then you take a very simple kil@@ n that you can make out of a waste fif@@ ty five-@@ gall@@ on oil dr@@ um .
in the second verse comes the line , &quot; the wind and waves o@@ be@@ y him . &quot;
we have to change .
there is a ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn orche@@ str@@ a living inside the building .
it sounds something like this .
i was so wa@@ sted . &quot;
i need some information , and i need a contain@@ er .
now there &apos;s a talent un@@ to itself .
you know something ? this has been achie@@ ved in india .
and we define ourselves by our g@@ ap@@ s .
and i thought about a solution to this problem .
audience : ra@@ w .
make room for it .
but they were empty .
they do ta@@ st@@ ings of these ingre@@ di@@ ents in the gar@@ den@@ ing clas@@ ses .
very very hard .
they laugh@@ ed together .
and then when i did the second one , it really dist@@ ur@@ bed the piece -- these big blue lines cr@@ as@@ hing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of ten@@ sion and an over@@ la@@ p .
you can see the detail .
now in this reci@@ pe you also have the cost .
you should have always a structure of living and working together .
there &apos;s a counter@@ intui@@ tive trend that we noticed in these numbers . so let &apos;s look at the first me@@ tri@@ c here , over@@ w@@ inter@@ ing survival .
and let me show you what happened .
and we also sam@@ pl@@ ed the out@@ door air .
i &apos;m not on top of the class .
doctor se@@ li@@ g@@ man , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
here we have a problem .
so thank you very much .
i even met one of them and she was just about my size .
i just obser@@ ved .
they &apos;re just not moving .
and then something happened in 19@@ 80 .
this is a remote center at the university of washington .
once they got over the sho@@ ck , though , by and large people op@@ ted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent mar@@ ks .
they &apos;re all different .
we can be pre@@ vent@@ ative ; that pre@@ ven@@ tion can be person@@ alized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
data is relationships .
they are farmers and factory workers .
i did this building in japan .
the perspective was , here is this poor professor .
it prote@@ cts the birds .
so , huge trage@@ dy .
i believe in real life .
we don &apos;t see those nuclear re@@ actions in stars .
when he wal@@ ks onto the floor of the american exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time st@@ ops for him . and it st@@ ops ti@@ ll the clo@@ sing bell .
it &apos;s a very simple example .
n thank you .
he went into a com@@ a .
this is a piece of property in br@@ ent@@ wood .
every year a million and a half people die of a completely pre@@ vent@@ able disease . that &apos;s malaria . 6@@ ,000 people a day .
that is , our hous@@ ing has become a com@@ modi@@ ty .
and this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
we can he@@ al the disease .
it &apos;s a commercial example .
but there came a moment when it all came together , and everything worked .
so , it was going no@@ where .
the age is 400 years .
and so , in 2004 , they com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed us to do a screen test of ben@@ jam@@ in .
and they are not the only one that makes the cros@@ sing .
and they bel@@ ong on the si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks , and they &apos;ll use it seriously . &quot;
we do it again .
the machine itself would start the music .
and so in the next two to five years , this sen@@ sor could poten@@ tially li@@ ft for pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer survival rates from a dis@@ mal 5@@ .@@ 5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for o@@ vari@@ an and lung cancer .
my team and i have exam@@ ined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from cas@@ sin@@ i .
and third , the engagement in developing countries was with a nar@@ row set of government eli@@ tes with little interaction with the citizens , who are the ulti@@ mate bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries of development assi@@ stance .
you see him all the time .
and the same pattern emer@@ ged in each conflict .
she doesn &apos;t see the point .
but it will not be possible in the future any more .
it &apos;s so un@@ comfortable .
meet tony . he &apos;s my student .
in resour@@ ce-@@ rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born hiv-@@ positive -- 9@@ 8 percent of babies are born hiv-@@ negative .
once you &apos;ve done that , then there &apos;s the compu@@ tation step .
the technology revolution is opening the world .
now , so i know the frequ@@ ency .
it was incredibly successful .
this is not just in he@@ bre@@ w , by the way .
and that will have led to speci@@ alization .
it &apos;s the physical construction of impro@@ ved spaces and materials and experiences for teachers and students .
they &apos;re related dist@@ antly to th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ines .
in swe@@ den we read it once and then we went part@@ ying .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
this is very exciting for those players .
so you can do a glam@@ ori@@ zed picture of a car , but you can &apos;t do a glam@@ ori@@ zed picture of traffic .
so here we go .
i came back after two months and the children tro@@ op@@ ed in and said , &quot; we &apos;ve understood nothing . &quot;
we feel so good about ourselves .
just fold up the wings and keep going .
so i read slowly .
so , effectively we created a digital pu@@ p@@ pet that bra@@ d pit@@ t could operate with his own face .
b@@ c : we enter the mar@@ ti@@ an atmosphere .
it &apos;s certainly not like china .
the effects of this are well known . they are everywhere .
do you think the spi@@ ke is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
it looks a bit like this .
it all began for him during world war ii , when at age 17 he found himself thr@@ ust into a for@@ ged docum@@ ents work@@ shop .
and this is just an illu@@ stration .
we happen to get round to testing , let &apos;s say , new@@ ton &apos;s law of gravity about 300 years ago .
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here .
glam@@ or@@ ous and rich .
we then place it in an o@@ ven@@ -@@ like device , and we &apos;re able to create that structure and bring it out .
that &apos;s two days ago .
and there goes the question , especially if you ask gro@@ wers , agri@@ cul@@ tu@@ ri@@ sts : why biological control ?
all of that is over .
it was bor@@ ing .
the phr@@ ase &apos; art is whatever &apos; expres@@ ses the current inclu@@ si@@ ven@@ ess that surro@@ unds ar@@ t-@@ making -- a sort of &apos; it a@@ in &apos;t what you do , it &apos;s the way that you do it &apos; notion .
and even studies of co@@ operation show that co@@ operation between individuals lights up reward centers of the brain .
and what we &apos;re facing in africa is an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented threat to human dig@@ ni@@ ty and equ@@ ality .
that &apos;s what engineers do . &quot;
you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever .
it &apos;s really serious .
i brought it here .
some of these law@@ yers were successful ; they managed to get new trials for their cli@@ ents .
it felt like a revolution .
so you can see : here we are in the u.s. , and they &apos;re all coming up red .
i say , &quot; online organi@@ zing . &quot;
she is really the center of the health care system .
you see this with twitter , too . you get this information over@@ load .
bring it back up .
that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
mo : data .
you &apos;re using your buil@@ t-@@ in dynam@@ ics , the physics of your body , just like a pen@@ dul@@ um .
that is the power of organic design .
they &apos;re going to ed@@ dy in la@@ gos .
b@@ ye@@ -@@ b@@ ye .
without the sex part .
these are major issues .
here &apos;s another one .
a new fron@@ tier has been found .
an amazing woman .
i pulled them asi@@ de .
and i had to qu@@ it and come and do this thing called a better place .
and then one day , it happened : he and his family were ar@@ re@@ sted and they were taken to a death house on the dan@@ u@@ be .
it &apos;s flo@@ wn around the world .
kt : no .
and we have a cool atmosphere .
this was a critical mistake .
they can get basic u@@ tili@@ ties like electricity .
but i didn &apos;t find any .
they got themselves ready .
mo@@ ses ! -- the boys in michael mor@@ pur@@ go &apos;s &quot; friend or fo@@ e ; &quot; al@@ em in ben@@ jam@@ in ze@@ ph@@ ani@@ ah &apos;s &quot; re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e boy ; &quot; lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker -- lu@@ ke sky@@ wal@@ ker ! -- oli@@ ver twi@@ st ; cas@@ si@@ a in &quot; the con@@ cu@@ bine of shang@@ hai &quot; by h@@ ong ying ; cel@@ ie in ali@@ ce wal@@ ker &apos;s &quot; the color pur@@ ple . &quot;
so you can la@@ vis@@ h all the same care , all the same techni@@ que , on a ham@@ bur@@ ger as you would on some much more fan@@ cy dis@@ h .
now , how do we de@@ du@@ ce where the galaxy is ?
5@@ 2 million people die of natural causes each year cor@@ respon@@ ds , then , to 5@@ 2 million vol@@ um@@ es destro@@ yed .
he : well it goes to the last point that i was at .
i really was moved .
and the purpose is not to walk in and constru@@ ct a home and live there .
here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
the ge@@ om@@ et@@ ric mean of the mass of a pro@@ ton and the mass of the sun is 50 kil@@ ogra@@ ms , within a factor of two of the mass of each person here .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
so i was fil@@ ming .
but unfortunately , 95 percent of the gl@@ aci@@ ers in the arc@@ tic are also re@@ ce@@ ding right now to the point that the ice is en@@ ding up on land and not inje@@ cting any ice back into the ecosystem .
how do you discover the uni@@ qu@@ eness of a project as unique as a person ?
can you imagine , you &apos;ve got the dollar on view and there &apos;s no del@@ hi bel@@ ly in there anymore .
you get something a little bit more complicated .
but if you dis@@ played that on a cr@@ t or flat pan@@ el display , it would be meaning@@ less to hold up an arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary object , a real world object in that .
che@@ f : oh , you don &apos;t know ? let me tell you something .
and that &apos;s what i do with my fur@@ ni@@ ture .
it took us 50 years to reach an@@ nu@@ al sav@@ ings rat@@ ings of almost 10 percent . 50 years .
ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty is the mother of evolution .
it &apos;s that pyrami@@ d .
every conc@@ ei@@ vable way you can v@@ ary sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce , he vari@@ ed sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tt@@ i sau@@ ce .
and our joy of music , etc . , etc . ... &quot;
it didn &apos;t work .
and i expla@@ ined , &quot; it &apos;s a dark night and a cro@@ w is per@@ ching on a bran@@ ch . &quot;
ma@@ ir@@ a kal@@ man : the illu@@ strated woman
and because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s en@@ co@@ ded for in the dna of this organis@@ m .
and we had an increase in income .
and then you enter into the living room and then so on .
he thought hard . i mean , it was nearly 80 years before this that he &apos;d been at this hu@@ t .
they don &apos;t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swa@@ p has ex@@ pi@@ red , they still don &apos;t like their picture . why ?
re@@ zero kee@@ ps his balance by constantly meas@@ uring his pit@@ ch angle with a sen@@ sor .
so i showed him .
lou@@ is ka@@ hn , yes !
and the world population will stop growing .
you can watch me for one minute now and you &apos;ll see the whole thing .
two weeks after my diagno@@ sis , a bi@@ op@@ sy con@@ fir@@ med i had a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch o@@ ste@@ o@@ sar@@ com@@ a in my left fe@@ mu@@ r .
and then , finally hits the floor .
and so we built some very sophisti@@ cated radio anten@@ n@@ as just for prob@@ ing both walls and se@@ arch@@ ing for an air gap .
but i think from the point of view of a ne@@ anderth@@ al , there would have been a lot of dis@@ appro@@ val of the wi@@ mp@@ ish ch@@ op@@ pers that we now have .
in addition to multiple choice and the kinds of short answer questions that you saw in the video , we can also grade math , mathematical expres@@ sions as well as mathematical der@@ i@@ va@@ tions .
this is exactly what happens in your body .
but he made mistakes in a good direction .
i know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
this is in response to , what &apos;s beautiful ? &quot; miss world . &quot;
you shouldn &apos;t worry about me . dad doesn &apos;t need to go to work .
and serious competition from europe , from korea , and next is china , which will soon be a major net ex@@ por@@ ter of cars .
what is fu@@ zz@@ y rop@@ e , you ask ?
but we want to tell the world that , no , under the one fla@@ g , we &apos;ll still re@@ main as ye@@ men@@ i people .
this is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about geno@@ cide or nuclear pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation or poverty or any other hu@@ gely con@@ sequ@@ enti@@ al issue .
it &apos;s a bit e@@ er@@ ie , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
three sides , such steps , on the fourth side there is a four@@ -@@ story building where you can organi@@ ze such ted con@@ fer@@ ences any@@ time .
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot;
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
if a new@@ t can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
governments are not changing it . why ?
and then if that no@@ de has cancer , the woman would go on to get the ax@@ ill@@ ary ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ de dis@@ section .
it &apos;s more with less and less again .
so the question is , how do they deal with this material ?
you can continue to inno@@ v@@ ate and inv@@ ent .
199@@ 5 , we found three . the count now is up to 80 -- we &apos;re finding about two or three a month .
they consu@@ me more co@@ ca leaves than any human population , half a po@@ und per man , per day .
i felt very happy to be at the secon@@ dar@@ y school , so i was determin@@ ed to do anything possible to recei@@ ve education .
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this .
i couldn &apos;t take it to a laboratory and experiment with it .
one in a hundred .
that &apos;s what i get asked all the time .
the whole emerging world jo@@ ins the western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poor@@ est billion .
he ran and worked in a factory .
we &apos;re the ones who let the second repli@@ c@@ ator out of its box , and we can &apos;t push it back in .
and that &apos;s how it popul@@ ates this map .
this is a kind of op@@ tical deal , right ?
and now , 20@@ 12 .
so i will do this .
we still need to complete the scre@@ ening study using the low do@@ se , and then our fin@@ dings will need to be repli@@ cated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
the dolph@@ in &apos;s at the key@@ board .
but people did not rel@@ ate to this .
like those big explo@@ sions , spar@@ ks , are from a little com@@ b j@@ el@@ ly , and there &apos;s kri@@ ll and other kinds of cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans , and j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important .
so then , you move off to this larger sphere of &quot; human + , &quot; and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible mo@@ des of being .
ten@@ sions between these two families date back to 19@@ 13 when there was a dis@@ pu@@ te over local political power .
and so i got some training and went and worked in africa during most of my 20@@ s .
and she said , &quot; i learned something today .
mar@@ co temp@@ est : when asked about de@@ ception , he said this : magic is the only honest prof@@ ession .
we have 25 posi@@ tions right now -- all of them trained , board cer@@ ti@@ fied in the usa , canada or britain .
and the people thought , &quot; you know , you &apos;re right .
and you see this post .
but what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
and this is all done , by the way , by the international astronom@@ ical union .
and then there is sta@@ tic ap@@ ne@@ a .
think about war .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
you may rec@@ all a year ago when a fire@@ stor@@ m er@@ up@@ ted after the united states pre@@ ven@@ tive services task force re@@ vie@@ wed the world &apos;s mammo@@ graph@@ y scre@@ ening liter@@ ature and issu@@ ed a gui@@ del@@ ine re@@ com@@ men@@ ding against scre@@ ening mammo@@ gra@@ ms in women in their 4@@ 0s .
ren@@ der@@ ing auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity -- and the key@@ word is &quot; ren@@ der@@ ing . &quot;
i can still see h@@ ill@@ ary doing the sh@@ ots of r@@ ye , dri@@ b@@ bling down her ch@@ in , with the steel workers .
it &apos;s called hu@@ t@@ chin@@ son@@ -@@ gil@@ ford pro@@ geria , and it is the most dra@@ matic form of pre@@ ma@@ ture aging .
i said , &quot; mr@@ s. al@@ isch , how are you ? &quot;
but i think they &apos;re beautiful , don &apos;t you ?
you do that , you give me your quick 15@@ -@@ second or 3@@ 0-@@ second in@@ tr@@ o , gra@@ b my attention .
it is an easy answer .
you see him with his original device on the left there after eight months of use , and on the right , it is two months .
so i &apos;ll just let you read .
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s kind of ne@@ at .
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
and the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult docum@@ ent for us .
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
so here &apos;s a tumor .
people , you can all do that .
british physi@@ c@@ ist john ty@@ n@@ d@@ all , in the 18@@ 50 &apos;s , made laboratory measu@@ re@@ ments of the in@@ fr@@ ared radiation , which is heat .
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simpli@@ city .
so i think in the next decade , the sci@@ ences and the human@@ i@@ ties will come closer together to be able to answer deep questions about man@@ kind .
this is another species of work that i do .
the progra@@ mm@@ ers come and go .
you &apos;re sitting on cha@@ irs .
so the better news is the future &apos;s almost here -- and the future is tissue engineering .
you know , we &apos;re the smar@@ test thing out there , why can &apos;t we figure this out ?
so light is , of course , for social interaction also -- to create relationships with all the fe@@ atures around us .
b@@ har@@ ti see@@ ks to liber@@ ate this everyday c@@ liche , as she calls it , by explo@@ ding it into something spec@@ tac@@ ular .
characteri@@ zed by a feeling of energi@@ zed focus , full invol@@ vement and success in the process of the activity .
and you could stuff p@@ ins in them .
by revolution , i mean a dra@@ stic and far@@ -@@ reach@@ ing change in the way we think and be@@ have -- the way we think and the way we be@@ have .
in our home@@ town , we trained a hal@@ f-@@ do@@ zen resi@@ dents to run these web tools on their own .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be working very well does it ?
do you want to do it , fr@@ ance ?
he &apos;s a dog that bel@@ on@@ gs to a family in mom@@ bas@@ a in kenya .
the navi@@ gation is difficult .
he creates these op@@ ul@@ ent tab@@ le@@ aus inspired by hier@@ ony@@ mus bo@@ sch , but also by the k@@ as@@ h@@ mir@@ i tex@@ ti@@ les of his you@@ th .
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about that . &quot;
and they &apos;re not all bad .
acade@@ mi@@ a says no .
and the mother is el@@ der@@ ly .
and the whole spirit and at@@ titude in those schools is very different than in the normal public schools .
and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
and so he agre@@ ed .
so , the first set of path@@ ologi@@ es , they end up in the stick man on his ic@@ on , but the rest of them are really what &apos;s important here .
the world is bu@@ z@@ zing at the moment with plans to force re@@ duc@@ tions in gas emissions at all costs .
can you show us how good of a pilot you are ?
we so r@@ ar@@ ely look at the sky .
it is transpar@@ ent , made just for you .
what forms of suffering could be alle@@ vi@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about co@@ operation ?
and here are the results of this wonderful project that is the system in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela .
this was considered as first evidence that actually black holes come from super@@ no@@ va@@ e explo@@ sions .
i know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
all we ask is , &quot; what ser@@ ves my interests ? &quot;
we re@@ vis@@ ed the mental health compon@@ ent of the primary health care services by ad@@ ding psycho@@ -@@ social care and psycho@@ -@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ors to the system .
and then i &apos;ve mentioned the avail@@ ability .
and there will be no mistakes . &quot;
the science is clear .
we started to look out in other fields .
and why does sex make babies , and babies sp@@ ell ero@@ tic disaster in cou@@ ples ?
which they do .
the electricity is free .
near that was me@@ than@@ e . i &apos;ve never seen vol@@ can@@ o@@ es of me@@ than@@ e .
ph : there &apos;s been an un@@ easy relationship between the tv business and the tech business , really ever since they both turned about 30 .
we color every neuron in , in a different color , and then we look through all of the images , find the sy@@ nap@@ ses and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each sy@@ nap@@ se .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
they just don &apos;t like it .
we used it at lo@@ yo@@ la on the cha@@ pel , and it didn &apos;t work .
but i do that all the time .
it &apos;s the most important map of all .
it &apos;s because of cur@@ tis co@@ op@@ er that we know , currently the largest prime number we know , is 2 ^ 5@@ 7@@ ,@@ 8@@ 8@@ 5@@ ,@@ 16@@ 1 .
maybe you can re@@ lie@@ ve the phan@@ tom pain , the phan@@ tom cra@@ mp .
the number across the u.s. and western europe is eight percent .
how would i know who was the best ?
and what do you de@@ dic@@ ate it to , in explor@@ ing a particular thing ?
i was like , &quot; yeah .
tra@@ ch@@ om@@ a is an infe@@ ction of the eye due to di@@ rt can leave you perman@@ ently blind .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- docum@@ ents , data ?
and the same is true for the tro@@ ops .
and so this is what they do .
and the reason is , it &apos;s been done .
to give you an example , between 2001 and 200@@ 2 , ethi@@ op@@ ian ma@@ ize farmers produced two years of bu@@ mp@@ er harv@@ est .
you know when they do home@@ works at home ?
they even created an e-@@ card so you could send your friend a dan@@ cing sp@@ las@@ h@@ y .
but there &apos;s a fantastic way to do that in the modern world .
this is the war@@ p and we@@ ft .
and you even find a church .
people that were hun@@ gry and hur@@ ting were sign@@ aling their dist@@ ress , were sign@@ aling their need for help .
and one of them is called ta@@ ket@@ a . which is which ?
you need something like tens of me@@ gat@@ ons of water -- almost a gi@@ gat@@ on of water -- in order to have any chance of cat@@ ching this neu@@ trin@@ o .
the g@@ 8 sum@@ mit pro@@ pos@@ es that the solution to africa &apos;s problems should be a massive increase in aid , something ak@@ in to the mar@@ shall plan .
and what i &apos;m telling you here from the signal , is that men who have a mu@@ tation in this an@@ tivi@@ ral defen@@ se enzy@@ me , and have a tumor , often have -- 40 percent of the time -- a sig@@ nature which reve@@ als a new retro@@ virus .
that has not happened at all in space flying .
and , most importantly , what causes the clu@@ sters ?
do you see where i &apos;m going with this ?
so , this is what happened when p@@ n@@ as published this .
it took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
if they had had an olymp@@ ics in mar@@ ty@@ r@@ dom , my grandmother would have lost on purpose .
see what the wars in r@@ wand@@ a .
wild dogs did eat a few of the she@@ ep , but the th@@ yl@@ ac@@ ine got a bad ra@@ p .
and the grandmother had never let any west@@ ern@@ ers ever see her .
would they give me char@@ ts and graph@@ s that i could color ?
let &apos;s put it that way .
george de me@@ stra@@ l -- this is not bu@@ gs all over a bir@@ ken@@ stock -- was walking his dog in a field and got covered in bur@@ rs , sort of little pri@@ ck@@ ly things , and from that came vel@@ cr@@ o .
for example , there is french chinese food , where they serve s@@ alt and pe@@ pp@@ er fro@@ g legs .
he appar@@ ently lost an eye in battle , which is why he is always shown in profi@@ le .
because the world is big .
they send him to iraq .
when i was writing up my notes oil was $ 1@@ 40 per bar@@ re@@ l .
this is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status qu@@ o , including the status qu@@ o of big and invasi@@ ve government .
but it &apos;s not that simple .
it &apos;s too late .
it seems that somehow , a trau@@ matic event can un@@ lock our ability to lead a life with fewer re@@ gre@@ ts .
now , as we brea@@ the , we produce carbon dio@@ xide , and that carbon dio@@ xide needs to be sc@@ ru@@ b@@ bed out of the system .
think about it , all right ? i &apos;m going to answer the phone three different times .
they want to make people live in fear .
and that was the language of the war .
how do you en@@ sure it gets to them and it impro@@ ves their lives ?
that &apos;s about that big .
but he had been so afraid of conflict , until finally he became more afraid of the sil@@ ence .
you probably saw the hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ale foot@@ age that we got there a month or two ago off coun@@ ty we@@ x@@ ford .
and they haven &apos;t collap@@ sed .
and the woman would have sex with it .
and we &apos;re getting there .
this is 198@@ 3 .
there was hollywood .
to@@ es have become an origami me@@ me , because everyone &apos;s doing it .
but that &apos;s not all .
and it &apos;s a real sh@@ ame . now why has this come about ?
that this old man would inter@@ ru@@ pt his mo@@ on@@ light stro@@ ll with his s@@ wee@@ the@@ art with the pre@@ cise reason of making fun of a child .
the opposite happened .
we didn &apos;t know about x@@ key@@ sc@@ ore . we didn &apos;t know about cyber@@ tr@@ ans .
that &apos;s his hair . you get a lot of figu@@ re-@@ ground problems .
the folks at a@@ ero@@ viron@@ ment tried 300 or more different wing designs , 12 different forms of the a@@ vi@@ on@@ ics .
that looks like this .
so we have got to create in this world also institutions for pe@@ ac@@ e@@ keeping and human@@ it@@ arian aid , but also for re@@ construction and security for some of the confli@@ c@@ t-@@ ri@@ dden states of the world .
6@@ 0,000 species are known to science , but more than 1.@@ 5 million have been esti@@ ma@@ ted to exist .
i was really concerned about having to wear this g@@ ad@@ get on my face .
and this is what the next piece is about .
this is known as the theme building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very mur@@ ky .
it &apos;s so un@@ interesting .
and so i ended up walking like this .
so the question is , how hard would it be to assem@@ ble this , right ?
and he &apos;s on a mission .
the majority of people .
you can get eight , 10 minutes of wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness -- how nasa &apos;s trained their astron@@ au@@ ts for so long .
you can imagine , with 2,000 syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed youtube videos , the ren@@ der time is just at@@ ro@@ cious .
eli@@ z@@ ab@@ eth : this man has se@@ duced a ward of the queen , and she has married without ro@@ y@@ al con@@ sent .
many auth@@ ors feel this pressure , but non-@@ western auth@@ ors feel it more hea@@ vi@@ ly .
so those are the three a &apos;s .
and so thinking back , i was thinking those of us in silicon valley were really focused on products or objects -- certainly technologi@@ cal objects .
especially when they &apos;re up@@ side down , you &apos;re eng@@ aging that general fac@@ ial recogni@@ tion software there .
it &apos;s like , &quot; u@@ gh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re chri@@ sti@@ ans .
and shor@@ tly after , we left the country , and we re@@ turned to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
i was so proud .
now , that might seem a bit wh@@ im@@ si@@ cal , but this per@@ v@@ asi@@ ven@@ ess of this tenden@@ cy towards spon@@ tane@@ ous order sometimes has un@@ expected consequences .
5@@ 29 .
well we &apos;re ja@@ zz musi@@ cians , so stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to fin@@ ance .
us@@ eless .
what my purpose of the talk today really is , is to sort of inde@@ li@@ bly sc@@ ar your minds with these char@@ is@@ matic and ma@@ je@@ stic creatures .
audience : species on this planet have evolved with imm@@ une systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to pro@@ create .
my ancestors moved to the united states .
thank you .
and we all had all of that on ta@@ pes .
how is it possible to do this without a brain ?
this is cis@@ -@@ 3@@ -@@ h@@ ex@@ en@@ e-@@ 1@@ -@@ ol . it sm@@ ells of cut gr@@ ass .
and that &apos;s the way i work now .
is this really how econom@@ ies be@@ have ? &quot;
definitely not perfect . so you would probably shu@@ t it , at this point .
so , basically , the production sur@@ plus of these guys down there is enough to main@@ tain this bio@@ mass that is not moving .
and i was part of that .
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
statisti@@ cally speaking , there is no difference in how often the ne@@ anderth@@ al mat@@ ches one african or the other .
ted@@ x .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thanks very much .
good after@@ noon .
good after@@ noon .
i think we have the money and brains in the room to do that .
and that &apos;s a quite clever guy , hu@@ h ?
if i had won everything -- but it was like , what was the point ?
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
so , there &apos;s 40 of these tu@@ bes , like a v-@@ 40 engine running the memory .
we found in our gang -- and , ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly , this was not really sort of a standard situation ; this was a time of inten@@ se violence -- of a lot of gang wars -- as this gang actually became quite successful . but there were costs .
you can see that i even made a museum lab@@ el for it that inclu@@ des a brief history of the do@@ do .
no big deal .
for a long time it was not believed when the first western travel@@ ers , like sir fran@@ c@@ is dra@@ ke , went to th@@ a@@ il@@ and and came back with tal@@ es of this un@@ belie@@ vable spec@@ tac@@ le .
i &apos;ll tell you how big the le@@ ver is : the le@@ ver is that big .
we need new anti-@@ vir@@ als and cock@@ ta@@ ils . we need new kinds of vac@@ cin@@ es .
and this starts happening all the time .
long distance running was not only good for my well-@@ being but it helped me medi@@ tate and dream big .
most of the time , we are in institutions , so the stanford prison study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior .
so let &apos;s see what that looks like .
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true .
and it has to be free .
so what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
so what can we do to think about bor@@ ders differently in this part of the world ?
and so if we look at recent cr@@ as@@ hes -- the whole data set is almost 30 years &apos; worth of data -- you won &apos;t see it in the recent cr@@ as@@ hes . the new car se@@ ats are far , far better . &quot;
thank you .
now , without that , how could we possibly function ?
and i tell you stories from there .
but i wasn &apos;t into selling wh@@ is@@ key ; i was into selling ice .
and this influ@@ enced me .
that &apos;s very important .
all they had was mi@@ ke &apos;s hard le@@ mon@@ ade , which was five percent al@@ co@@ hol .
&quot; the sna@@ il . &quot;
and no@@ ki@@ a as well .
and wikipedia has embra@@ ced this .
well , with the pi@@ g , at the bas@@ eline , before we blo@@ cked the pi@@ g &apos;s ar@@ tery to simu@@ late a heart attack , that was the signal .
my technology .
in winter , there &apos;s a lot of sle@@ eping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
it &apos;s right here .
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot;
seriously .
in the mean@@ while , let me conclu@@ de the first part of my show by doing something a little tri@@ ck@@ ier .
ra@@ ch@@ el na@@ om@@ i re@@ men is a better doctor because of her life@@ -@@ long struggle with cro@@ hn &apos;s disease .
the political climate in the u.s. at the time was ten@@ se , and there were deb@@ ates going on about im@@ migra@@ tion .
and he sig@@ ns off , &quot; thank you . &quot;
also , research within the continent is a lot easier to condu@@ ct due to wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad poverty , en@@ de@@ mic diseases and in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate health care systems .
so i have shown you this to demon@@ strate how many bo@@ ats , how many ves@@ sel@@ s it takes to catch one of these guys .
to par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase cha@@ ve@@ z , once social change begins , it cannot be rever@@ sed .
you now , our brain is two to three percent of the body mass , but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use .
this is that ro@@ cket going up .
and i , one day , i announ@@ ced this to my parents -- and my father den@@ ies this story to this day -- i said , &quot; da@@ d@@ dy , i want to be a di@@ pl@@ om@@ at . &quot;
in 200@@ 2 , a group of treatment activi@@ sts met to disc@@ uss the early development of the airplane .
lau@@ ren ho@@ dge : if you were going to a restaurant and wanted a heal@@ thi@@ er option , which would you choose , gri@@ ll@@ ed or fri@@ ed chicken ?
it was a 200@@ -@@ foot diam@@ e@@ ter ge@@ o@@ des@@ ic sphere to be sus@@ pen@@ ded over the east river in new york city , in full view of the united nations .
markets have changed beyond recogni@@ tion in the last 20 years , but only for organizations at the top of the economy .
so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stron@@ ger bri@@ qu@@ ette so that we could compe@@ te with wood char@@ coal in the markets in haiti .
and it got big enough to the point where there was a flo@@ at last year at the ma@@ cy &apos;s th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving day par@@ ade , and ri@@ ck ast@@ ley po@@ ps out , and ri@@ ck@@ roll@@ s millions of people on television .
and this is after two years .
it was started by er@@ ik win@@ free , and what it does , it has ti@@ les that are a hundre@@ d@@ th the size of a dna origami .
this is the death star .
yes , you know it .
thank you .
for me , the ho@@ b@@ bi@@ es that i have are really just new work projects that i &apos;ve launched .
so for the past few years , the co@@ ast@@ al areas , they found themselves in a shor@@ tage of labor .
but even in his wil@@ dest dreams , lincol@@ n could never have imag@@ ined how far his repu@@ tation would reach .
and now the king co@@ br@@ a is a new one .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m learning . &quot;
ta@@ yl@@ or wil@@ son : y@@ up , i built a nuclear fusion re@@ actor
that &apos;s the change .
thank you .
well , we looked at the tissue under the microscop@@ e .
it was awful .
it &apos;s been fantastic .
both success@@ es and fail@@ ures teach us several cri@@ tically important things that we need to bear in mind if we want the good news to continue .
to change its state , by the way , takes two vol@@ ts from a milli@@ second pul@@ se .
and this was , unfortunately , successful .
and i went to see the do@@ z@@ o .
it &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable .
two nor@@ we@@ gi@@ ans did it as a team in 2000 . no one &apos;s done it sol@@ o .
on land , life turned a corner . ja@@ ws formed first ; teeth came later .
his biggest ob@@ stac@@ le , really , was the market@@ place , which dem@@ ands these days bright yellow fo@@ ie gras .
i was seven .
so , how far does e@@ ter@@ ni@@ ty go ?
and you have the market revolution of the 198@@ 0s and the huge increase of ine@@ quality in societies .
and it &apos;s not a diet .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic stat@@ ements .
and this was 2007 .
what o@@ kol@@ lo@@ h did would not have been possible without human gener@@ osity .
it was extraordinary .
because you might say , &quot; well , this type of surgery might be re@@ gar@@ ded as co@@ s@@ me@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; listen , i &apos;m going back to the s@@ w@@ amp mer@@ ma@@ id . can you call me in a little while ? &quot;
and there &apos;s some complicated cr@@ yp@@ to@@ graph@@ y going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is vot@@ ing with one of these forms .
you know , if they said , you know what ?
it &apos;s not only been killed , but it &apos;s been den@@ i@@ ed any potential for creating future life .
and he called the two of them to his office .
he re@@ ads one book of 12 and goes to a couple of lec@@ tures , mar@@ ches himself up to our room a couple days before the ex@@ am to get himself tu@@ tor@@ ed .
now , what is the signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of these mirror neurons ?
secon@@ dly , the government had ignor@@ ed all available alterna@@ tives to war , which in some ways was a more dis@@ cre@@ di@@ table thing still .
all of these are extra@@ cted directly from my bank accoun@@ ts , and everything po@@ ps up right away .
four very different habit@@ ats might look similar , but they &apos;ve got very different pollen sig@@ natur@@ es .
j@@ ul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor : spi@@ der@@ -@@ man , the li@@ on king and life on the creative edge
now , four years ago , chris lost his job , unfortunately , as an art bu@@ yer at ma@@ cy &apos;s , and like so many people , he strug@@ gl@@ ed to find a new one during the rec@@ ession .
we &apos;ve done stri@@ pping experiments where we &apos;ve re@@ moved ma@@ ts of epi@@ phy@@ tes and looked at the rates of re@@ col@@ oni@@ zation .
and there &apos;s nothing we do that is more cru@@ cial to our survival .
they don &apos;t read music .
and yet , we have nobody who is trying to en@@ sure that the next generation of children born to afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans and asi@@ ans come out with cre@@ am@@ y skin and yellow hair .
and that was what i did .
the one in the middle , on my kitchen table . not much difference .
but organs don &apos;t wait , and i went into surgery before i could say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
in architecture , it works just the same .
i received a box in the mail and it was wra@@ pped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
so me , general t@@ so &apos;s chicken and this lo@@ go are all kar@@ ma@@ cally related .
if it &apos;s a tail -- well , rather dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted@@ ly , you put the glas@@ ses away and put the cham@@ pagne back .
so , how many of you have ever gotten behind the whe@@ el of a car when you really shouldn &apos;t have been driving ?
so a year and a half ago , david and i , along with another research sta@@ ff@@ -@@ member , formed a company to acceler@@ ate the rate of progress and the race to manufac@@ ture product .
okay , the next fe@@ ature of consciousness , after this mar@@ vel@@ ous uni@@ fied conscious field , is that it fun@@ ctions caus@@ ally in our behavior .
ak : so if you go to the website john@@ n@@ y@@ cas@@ h@@ proje@@ ct@@ .com , what you &apos;ll see is the video playing above .
we need to try to encoura@@ ge people to come up with a way of extra@@ cting carbon out of the earth &apos;s atmosphere .
we can only make them , quote , &quot; pir@@ ates . &quot; and is that good ?
and then you heard the original .
so separ@@ ation -- hopefully with di@@ rt or con@@ cre@@ te , or being in a bas@@ ement -- distance and time is what will save you .
now , american copy@@ right and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
but this team of multi-@@ discipl@@ in@@ ary , highly skep@@ tical and ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly tal@@ ented researchers do agree on two things .
the ta@@ hl@@ tan have called for the creation of a tri@@ b@@ al her@@ it@@ age reser@@ ve which will set asi@@ de the largest prote@@ cted area in british colum@@ bia .
but it &apos;s all good in the grand sche@@ me of things .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
there &apos;s certainly a common theme about nee@@ ding to make the moment out of this .
but there &apos;s also wick@@ ed joy , you can re@@ jo@@ ice in someone &apos;s suffering .
i hope there &apos;s one thing you all won &apos;t forget : in between the time you arrived here this morning and the time we break for lunch , there are going to be four hom@@ i@@ ci@@ des in the united states .
most people find that very so@@ o@@ thing , and , interest@@ ingly , 12 cy@@ cles per minute is roughly the frequ@@ ency of the brea@@ thing of a sle@@ eping human .
this very basic shift in my physical ori@@ entation helped me shift my perspective in relation to the gl@@ aci@@ er .
so if you go to 2@@ 3@@ and@@ me , or if you go to coun@@ c@@ il@@ o@@ f@@ da@@ d@@ s@@ .com , you can click on a link .
but the story is not about these chap@@ ters .
you have , in effect , lost consciousness when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem .
so here he is .
so we have , in skin pig@@ ment@@ ation , one of these wonderful products of evolution that still has consequences for us today .
well , in 19@@ 00 , three percent of americans practic@@ ed professi@@ ons that were cogni@@ tively dem@@ and@@ ing .
10,000 square kilometers , tens of thousands of is@@ lands fl@@ ung like je@@ wel@@ s upon the southern sea .
in the case of g@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his telescop@@ e to saturn .
people have mur@@ dered those that they loved , belie@@ ving that they were mur@@ der@@ ing an im@@ poster .
each month requi@@ red 1,@@ 3@@ 65 calcu@@ lations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
but since there are very few other diseases that kill people , we can really at@@ tribu@@ te that mortality to hiv .
so we have these models -- argument as war , argument as pro@@ of , and argument as performance .
you see , technology &apos;s changing at a st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing rate , and that 25@@ 0,000 pieces of mal@@ ware won &apos;t stay the same for long .
the assu@@ mption then that we do best when the individual self choo@@ ses only hol@@ ds when that self is clearly divi@@ ded from others .
this is 198@@ 8 -- we actually bom@@ bed two ir@@ ani@@ an oil plat@@ forms that year .
darwin himself , by the way , had no dou@@ b@@ ts that the pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck &apos;s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the pe@@ a@@ hen .
so , how do you make education better ?
now , why is all this important , to have to go really fast ?
the u.s. const@@ it@@ ution is the gay agenda .
so then i said , &quot; nets , what do i do ? &quot;
when i stood there in the gr@@ ass , it &apos;s hot -- not even the sound of insects -- just this wa@@ ving gr@@ ass .
never have been .
we did this with the great tur@@ tle race -- tag@@ ged tur@@ tles , brought in four million hits .
in fact , it &apos;s as large as western europe , but it only has 300 miles of pa@@ ved roads .
i bel@@ ong to an internet discussion for@@ um , an african internet discussion for@@ um , and i asked them , i said , &quot; since 1960 , we &apos;ve had exactly 20@@ 4 african heads of state , since 1960 . &quot;
other students might be interested in a particular en@@ rich@@ ment top@@ ic that they want to pur@@ sue individu@@ ally .
i &apos;ve got par@@ ent@@ -@@ child rela@@ tional problems , which i bl@@ ame my parents for .
and the most st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing thing of all of this , to me , is that not only is this a problem , not only do we recognize that this is a problem , but we &apos;ve had to suff@@ er fa@@ ke fi@@ xes .
but i see something pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly transforma@@ tive in experi@@ en@@ cing death as a social process and not just a biological one .
i continu@@ ed studying craft tradi@@ tions and collabor@@ ating with arti@@ s@@ ans , next in li@@ th@@ u@@ ania with l@@ ace makers .
only three of the negative trials were published , but all but one of the positive trials were published .
now when we &apos;re looking at solving big problems , we need to start thinking in two numbers .
now you &apos;d think that &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; would introdu@@ ce a measure of americ@@ ani@@ zation .
i was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery and becoming a surge@@ on , because it meant working with my hands in a very focused , inten@@ se way .
so is london a sc@@ aled up bir@@ m@@ ing@@ ham , which is a sc@@ aled up bri@@ gh@@ ton , etc . , etc . ?
we &apos;re not doing films for the eli@@ te and the people in their glass houses .
and i said , &quot; i have no training as a doctor . i never cla@@ im@@ ed that . &quot;
and that &apos;s the sad part .
and this gra@@ ff@@ iti artist has come along , made this sign a little bit better , and then moved on .
the post-@@ col@@ oni@@ al entrop@@ y that is happening around the world is acceler@@ ating , and i expect more such changes to occu@@ r in the map as the states frag@@ ment .
well , what is random ? what is chance ? what is lu@@ ck ?
but then on top of that , you know , sar@@ ah j@@ ones told me we only have 18 minutes .
that &apos;s one city .
that &apos;s a lot .
now , the eur@@ o was a new@@ ly born cur@@ ren@@ cy of great opportunity for business , and , of course , for investment .
a few minutes ago , i li@@ ken@@ ed min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing to a s@@ lot machine you &apos;d never want to play .
h@@ ul@@ u and net@@ fli@@ x , among other companies , have open vac@@ ation poli@@ cies .
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha .
in@@ ca sculp@@ tures are re@@ gar@@ ded as tre@@ as@@ ures in british muse@@ ums , while sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are is transl@@ ated into every major language of the earth .
for example , meas@@ les was four million of the dea@@ ths back as recently as 199@@ 0 and now is under 40@@ 0,000 .
and then you ask , why econom@@ ists ?
i don &apos;t think so .
nin@@ et@@ y-@@ six percent of college students say they have abo@@ ve-@@ average social skills .
but this is the source of innovation .
gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn &apos;t do a very good comp@@ en@@ sation .
imagine the blood flo@@ wing through your body -- i was told at u@@ cl@@ a medical center -- as one se@@ aled system .
and it took a lot of coura@@ ge for these defen@@ ders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in imple@@ ment@@ ing these laws .
and anti@@ body sta@@ in@@ ings like this one can be used to understand that sort of question .
what &apos;s interesting is the spi@@ ke on the back of the dra@@ cor@@ e@@ x was growing very fast as well .
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched publi@@ c@@ ly yet .
so what we had them do was memor@@ ize this lo@@ wer@@ -@@ left sound ic@@ on , please .
when a word was mentioned , an image of it inst@@ antly appe@@ ared in his mind .
now , i can ex@@ tend this cir@@ cular mag@@ net , and make whatever track i want .
p@@ m : there is a lot of energy here . lots of learning .
he r@@ ings the bell again . he says , &quot; we have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &quot; we have , all nations , po@@ ol@@ ed all our fun@@ ds together .
and i say , &quot; of course . &quot; and they say , &quot; so aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
you watch the video with super@@ im@@ posed graphi@@ cs that indi@@ cate your dep@@ th and comp@@ ass head@@ ing .
this is the math under@@ lying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
but it wasn &apos;t just us . even in the musli@@ m world , his definition of ji@@ had began to gain accep@@ tan@@ ce .
we re@@ ck@@ on that we are a bit over hal@@ f@@ way to our goal : zero impact , zero foot@@ print .
european governments , for the most part , haven &apos;t ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged responsibility , and there &apos;s nothing to kind of to push back and up against .
and i came from a very privi@@ le@@ ged background . i was very lucky .
right ? good .
don &apos;t ask .
and so all of us have this remarkable brain , which is poor@@ ly understood to say the least .
if we were to wi@@ pe out insects alone , just that group alone , on this planet -- which we are trying hard to do -- the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappe@@ ar from the land .
now here , our entire oceans are ev@@ a@@ por@@ ating off the surface , and as it kee@@ ps getting hot@@ ter at some point the entire planet &apos;s going to melt down .
two -- and it was two of spa@@ des , right ?
and i say , &quot; cate , what do you want to do ? &quot;
and , la@@ stly , under &quot; harmon@@ y , &quot; they had this 13@@ th-@@ century mand@@ ala from ti@@ bet .
so j@@ ul@@ ie &apos;s going to her doctor &apos;s office to get treated for her as@@ th@@ ma .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer .
and he wrote to the acade@@ mi@@ cians in paris , trying to explain his theory .
a@@ ve@@ li@@ le had the virus , she was born with the virus .
you send a comm@@ and down , it causes mus@@ cles to contra@@ ct .
and what you will find is a very , very low-@@ ran@@ king bit@@ ch will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-@@ ran@@ king male .
the next 3@@ 4 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your la@@ g@@ gar@@ ds .
i &apos;m going home for a mid@@ term . a ri@@ ot &apos;s going on on cam@@ pus .
and the answer is no .
and we use gs@@ i -- geographic whatever it is , gs@@ i -- to deter@@ mine the range of the ch@@ im@@ ps .
we need to face &apos; the other in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth . &apos; a global crisis in agriculture .
and let me just sum@@ mar@@ ize . so the bottom line : the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy than we do right now with this computer technology that we have .
in this ca@@ ve , great areas are covered by this red@@ dis@@ h material that you see here , and also these enormous cr@@ y@@ st@@ als of sel@@ en@@ ite that you can see dan@@ gling down .
so this whole subje@@ c@@ t-@@ object thing has relev@@ ance to humor in this way .
but here is a po@@ em from ye@@ ats . i &apos;ll just read you the last two lines .
what you &apos;re looking at is airplane traffic over north america for a 24@@ -@@ hour period .
7@@ 2 percent of the population has such sc@@ ars , but most don &apos;t shed the ge@@ ar , things like lo@@ b@@ ster tra@@ ps and cra@@ b po@@ ts .
by this stage the project had taken on a vi@@ ral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
the main sing@@ er disappe@@ ars at the beginning of the oper@@ a and the entire stage becomes the main character . it becomes his leg@@ acy .
there &apos;s a basic , profound acceler@@ ation of this evolutionary process .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16@@ -@@ minute trip on 7@@ 2 percent of the planet , so bu@@ ck@@ le up .
i want to share one story about an innovation called dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ gation .
the toi@@ lets there are literally holes in the ground covered with a woo@@ den sha@@ ck .
the world i en@@ vision for her -- how do i want men to be acting and be@@ having ?
it &apos;ll help my brea@@ thing . it &apos;ll do something for my pul@@ se , maybe .
now this is is@@ a@@ a@@ c from a viet@@ nam@@ ese stam@@ p .
the government recently announ@@ ced plans to return to the moon by 20@@ 24 .
he came up with our name and lo@@ go . we &apos;re mission mot@@ ors .
every time i brea@@ the in , i &apos;m brea@@ thing in a milli@@ on-@@ billi@@ on-@@ billion atoms of oxygen .
i spent a good deal of time with a man who lived with his family on a ra@@ il@@ way em@@ bank@@ ment and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident .
so you &apos;re out in the wo@@ ods , or you &apos;re out in the pa@@ st@@ ure , and you see this ant cra@@ w@@ ling up this bla@@ de of gr@@ ass .
i app@@ ren@@ tic@@ ed with a car@@ p@@ enter and learned about pl@@ um@@ b , square and level .
well now , my time is going , so i want to sing a song .
we will find a surprising and intri@@ gu@@ ing result about our universe , and to explain my point , let me first tell you what the hig@@ gs is about , and to do so , we have to go back to one tent@@ h of a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the big bang .
we &apos;re also working on noise can@@ cel@@ ing things like s@@ nor@@ ing , noise from automo@@ bil@@ es .
a range of explan@@ ations may be po@@ pping into your mind by now , like &quot; gre@@ ed . &quot;
because if there had been , they would have collap@@ sed under the gravi@@ ta@@ tional pull into a huge black hole .
i took a photo of that . sat down on my sle@@ dge . did a sort of video di@@ ary piece .
now as you can imagine , this is not very popular with four@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders .
and so guess what , scientists around the world and in the lab@@ s are ra@@ cing to conver@@ t aging adult cells -- aging adult cells from you and me -- they are ra@@ cing to re@@ program these cells back into more useful i@@ ps cells .
and who@@ ever tells you that they have nothing to hi@@ de simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
and i dre@@ w it out for her .
when you read this pra@@ yer , it sounds incredibly sel@@ fish , self-@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed .
in fact , when we &apos;re travel@@ ing ab@@ road , it &apos;s how we identify fellow can@@ adi@@ ans .
everybody else at the time of google , more or less , was trying to be a port@@ al .
so if you go back into the par@@ king , into the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ ors , it &apos;s almost like travel@@ ing into a par@@ alle@@ l universe from cars and colors , into this sort of sou@@ th-@@ facing urban o@@ as@@ is .
and i &apos;m sure you all know , this has created significant confli@@ cts between the agri@@ cultural and environmental communities .
then you don &apos;t need anything to control the car , except thinking about it .
i &apos;m going to show you how terror@@ ism actually inter@@ acts with our daily life .
everything had to be larger . the next painting was even bigger .
but the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , the same way it ag@@ gre@@ gates sar@@ gas@@ sum we@@ ed , actually is pul@@ ling in the plastic from throughout the region .
and finally , there was a population of students that were taught in a one-@@ on-@@ one instru@@ ction using a tu@@ tor .
now , my mother hop@@ ed that we learned from that the value of hard work .
the way to interpre@@ t this appar@@ ently simple graph is , on the ver@@ tical is an indi@@ cation of how complex care@@ gi@@ ver u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces are based on the l@@ ength of u@@ tter@@ an@@ ces .
when i started par@@ i@@ kr@@ ma i began with a great deal of ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ ce of trans@@ forming the world .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
here is another pretty typical scene . this is a sub@@ urban las v@@ eg@@ as neighborhood .
the electro@@ ly@@ te is not a solution of s@@ alt and water , but rather s@@ alt that &apos;s mel@@ ted .
we know that there was a len@@ ap@@ e sett@@ le@@ ment down here by the collect pon@@ d .
half the people who developed the food pyrami@@ d have ties to agri@@ business .
and unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the over@@ all form and the microscop@@ ic surface detail .
i believe that the political re@@ forms are a must for china to main@@ tain its growth .
is it that i write very well ?
what this means is that human development , not se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation , is what &apos;s key to women &apos;s em@@ power@@ ment in the trans@@ forming middle east .
i op@@ pose it -- that they are now going to dis@@ se@@ ct it , until i do my report and then i see the ch@@ ie@@ f com@@ man@@ der .
and so we found that the chimpanze@@ es do care about the well-@@ being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
that &apos;s so true .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoul@@ der all the time .
and may it run forever , because it gives people like me a living .
so i was in the museum of science at the time the tor@@ na@@ do hit , playing with the tor@@ na@@ do display .
k first time , a r@@ ally and a street play in a rural school -- un@@ heard of -- to tell their parents why liter@@ acy is important .
richard sau@@ l wur@@ man : i remember hearing him talk at pen@@ n .
when i got comfortable in the space , it also felt like a big play@@ ground .
the lesson of brian &apos;s pres@@ entation , in a way -- all those fantastic pictures -- is this really : that van@@ tage point determin@@ es everything that you see .
for example , in my first ted@@ talk , i did pro@@ pose that we should spend 21 billion hours a week as a planet playing video games .
but it turns out that re@@ gre@@ t feels awful in four very specific and consi@@ stent ways .
and that &apos;s seven and a half seconds of pro@@ sper@@ ity that you &apos;ve ga@@ ined since 19@@ 50 , as it were , because that &apos;s seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else , or you can ac@@ qui@@ re another good or service .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion .
but i brought along here a l@@ um@@ p of coal -- right here , one l@@ um@@ p of coal .
speaking of dinosaurs , sharks are basically the same fish they were 300 million years ago .
so it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in the upp@@ er part of this f@@ at@@ ty breast .
the problem is , without techni@@ cians , without sp@@ are parts , don@@ ations like this very quickly turn into jun@@ k .
and that &apos;s how i got out of high school .
it &apos;s down@@ h@@ ill from now on . i wanted to thank e@@ me@@ ka and chris .
you know how to imm@@ uni@@ ze kids , you know how to give bed nets . &quot;
you know the story .
the bri@@ de .
more than ever before it is these types of ideas which are driving growth on the cutting edge .
so they want an exc@@ use -- public opini@@ on is a very good exc@@ use to pun@@ ish him .
the first is to plan retro@@ fit@@ ting much more syste@@ mi@@ cally at the me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan scale .
we know that circum@@ c@@ ision redu@@ ces hiv infe@@ ction by 60 percent in men .
i found two trees -- but not any kind of trees , trees with character -- and then a very long rop@@ e .
when people have these simple ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal hallu@@ cin@@ ations , the primary visual cortex is activ@@ ated .
the c@@ d@@ c recently condu@@ cted a survey where they asked respon@@ dents simply to tell them whether they experienced significant psych@@ ological dist@@ ress in the previous week .
it turns out that elec@@ tor@@ al competition is the thing that &apos;s doing the damage with democracy , whereas strong che@@ cks and bal@@ an@@ ces make resource bo@@ oms good .
so amazing example of an adap@@ tation to a very resour@@ ce-@@ con@@ stra@@ ined environment -- and in that sense , very relevant to the kind of challenges we &apos;re going to be facing over the next few years , next few decades .
life magazine introduced generations of people to dist@@ ant , far@@ -@@ off cultures they never knew exi@@ sted through pictures .
another benefit of wi@@ -@@ f@@ i , we learned yesterday about the benefits of wi@@ -@@ f@@ i .
not only do ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates po@@ ll@@ ute our environment , but they also po@@ ll@@ ute our bodies .
we have art students getting together , taking old radi@@ ator parts and doing an ir@@ on-@@ po@@ ur to make something new out of it .
september 11 gener@@ ated some interest in moving it over to ground zero , and i &apos;m totally against that .
i had been using the first line of the nasa mission stat@@ ement , &quot; to understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justi@@ fy my talks .
they are saying , &quot; this is 35 miles per gall@@ on . i &apos;m going to do the environ@@ ment@@ ally right thing , i &apos;m going to buy the pri@@ us , 50 miles per gall@@ on . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ve been around for 3@@ 6 months , and this is it ? &quot;
so what this figure shows is that spi@@ ders date back to almost 3@@ 80 million years .
so the great thing about the mol@@ a is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here -- that &apos;s stre@@ aming off , that &apos;s right where we put the tag .
and then -- three par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ph@@ s later we get this little beauty : &quot; we went back to bla@@ ir house to look at the speech for the last time .
he wrote very , very positive re@@ vie@@ ws about himself . surprise , surprise .
this rei@@ ter@@ ation is a huge flying bu@@ t@@ tr@@ ess that comes out the tree itself .
so where do we go now ?
and my question is , how did we get from there to here ?
we trained in a t@@ ank in port hu@@ ene@@ me , and then my first open ocean di@@ ve was in s@@ ant@@ a bar@@ bar@@ a chan@@ nel .
so we had our own mini@@ ature rain@@ forest , a private beach with a coral re@@ e@@ f .
not just about its gene@@ tics and molecular biology , but up here in the meat end of the scale .
it brings ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary ban@@ king services to places where there &apos;s no ban@@ king infrastructure .
but i also want to rein@@ force some of the ideas we &apos;ve heard here , because having a me@@ a@@ dow or living by a me@@ a@@ dow is transforma@@ tional .
they &apos;re learning to fle@@ x this system that rele@@ ases their own en@@ do@@ gen@@ ous op@@ i@@ ates .
the star@@ t@@ ling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is exp@@ and@@ ing at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
inter@@ cro@@ pping . inter@@ cro@@ pping really incre@@ ases income .
on the ban@@ ks of a river called the indu@@ s , now in pakistan .
you need also state ow@@ ner@@ ship , especially of land asse@@ ts , in order to build and roll out infra@@ structures very quickly .
the institute of medicine study felt that you could not recy@@ cle mas@@ ks .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
the phan@@ tom lim@@ b -- they &apos;ll say , &quot; but doctor , the phan@@ tom lim@@ b is paraly@@ zed .
but then my mother said to me , &quot; i hear you &apos;ve been going around talking about psychop@@ ath@@ ic kill@@ ers .
we want you to walk up the h@@ ill in another two days &apos; time .
that impli@@ cation was studied by bol@@ tz@@ mann back in the 19@@ th century .
it sounds a little bit like a weird book , but actually they &apos;re all new types of lies .
your other option is a bit safe . your just going to get some money for sure .
in europe alone , by 20@@ 50 , there is going to be a 70 percent increase of individuals over 65 , and 1@@ 70 percent increase in individuals over 80 .
here we see a female cra@@ w@@ ling out of the ocean under mo@@ on@@ light on the island of tr@@ ini@@ dad .
un@@ accep@@ table . ne@@ pri@@ em@@ li@@ v .
people must choose for themselves , sometimes sti@@ cking to their g@@ uns , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of what other people want or re@@ com@@ men@@ d .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dic@@ tion@@ ary , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pur@@ suit as to &quot; ch@@ ase with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty . &quot;
and that makes sense .
she was wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ concerned about the be@@ ars , but she was terri@@ fied of law@@ yers .
i started see@@ king out tri@@ ath@@ le@@ tes because i found that li@@ fel@@ ong swi@@ mm@@ ers often couldn &apos;t teach what they did .
that &apos;s the responsibility of architec@@ ts .
or s@@ no@@ w@@ mobil@@ es . you don &apos;t need the s@@ now .
if you do come to cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , you will probably see an instal@@ lation by ai wei@@ we@@ i , the chinese artist .
it &apos;s motion and emotion .
but there was also many chri@@ stian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
now we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness .
but there are also hallu@@ cin@@ ations as well , and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are completely different .
why so ? because , in fact , the area of the lung is something very ill@@ -@@ defined .
we have a growing user base of this , and we network dom@@ es .
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot;
i could bar@@ ely brea@@ the . i was gas@@ ping for air .
what do we know about the country and the people that we pre@@ tend to protect , about the villa@@ ges where the only one medicine to kill the pain and to stop the hunger is op@@ ium ?
so even as we share death as a universal experience , it &apos;s not experienced the same way the world over .
she arrived at our reser@@ ve from a reser@@ ve east of us on her migr@@ atory rou@@ te .
which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what i actually like about my job .
with a screen it could in@@ form people or show them around in a fun and entertain@@ ing way .
if you &apos;re an out@@ board person@@ nel , now you stand up .
in the short term , we can stimu@@ late job growth by encoura@@ ging entreprene@@ ur@@ ship and by invest@@ ing in infrastructure , because the robots today still aren &apos;t very good at fix@@ ing bri@@ d@@ ges .
so already , the simul@@ ator is making me walk in exactly the same way as our wit@@ n@@ esses walked on the real bridge .
i would say that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa has done best in the world during the last 50 years .
but as the electr@@ ons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-@@ ra@@ ys .
you all know the story , right .
and this is an x-@@ ray showing you the patent , func@@ tional blood ves@@ sel .
so we &apos;re living in the age of sur@@ ging income ine@@ quality , especially at the top .
and with that , he success@@ fully organized 6@@ 8 law@@ yers who have been syste@@ matically taking the cases .
i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . i am the em@@ per@@ or of or@@ an@@ ges . &quot;
i went to per@@ forming arts high school , where i was an actor .
here we have our star field . here we have our shapes .
we have social areas inside the air@@ craft which might turn into a place where you can play virtual golf .
now , the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de in this soli@@ d graph , and look what happens to its temperature .
no . there will still be paper dic@@ tion@@ aries .
when he was eight , someone put him on a boat in o@@ des@@ sa and sent him , shi@@ pped him to israel on his own .
now , i &apos;ll show you a fun ap@@ p that -- we &apos;ve been working on a collaboration with our friends at fli@@ ck@@ r .
and that allows us to understand who &apos;s doing it well , and call them out , and find out what those techniques are .
it makes all key information about life on earth acc@@ essi@@ ble to anyone , on demand , anywhere in the world .
i do two things : i design mobile computers and i study brains .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down pay@@ ment on her house .
and that material in@@ duced the body to switch back on a heal@@ ing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
top right is stu@@ art mo@@ ore , a writer for ir@@ on man .
i put my fli@@ p@@ pers on . i could bar@@ ely part my li@@ ps .
i mean , s@@ ant@@ a cl@@ aus knows if you &apos;re n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty or nice , right ? &quot;
i no longer hear time &apos;s win@@ ged ch@@ ari@@ ot drawing near , or at least not as much as i did before .
was@@ su@@ p .
and we &apos;d also have a coffee shop , and the waste gra@@ ins from that could be used as a sub@@ strate for growing mush@@ rooms .
they looked for the un@@ wired places , and that &apos;s meant north and south , pri@@ mar@@ ily these c@@ ables to africa .
but in a small col@@ ony , it &apos;s likely to meet fewer for@@ a@@ gers , just because there are fewer other for@@ a@@ gers there to meet .
the new york times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was ro@@ ot@@ ing for lang@@ ley .
so if you compare comple@@ xi@@ ties to simpli@@ city , it &apos;s also cat@@ ching up in a way , too .
that way , each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars , and get incredible vari@@ ation in the components .
and so@@ on@@ er or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
it &apos;s just wrong .
there could be all sorts of technologies . and one is cell phones .
and by just pres@@ enting the sam@@ ples once more to the rat@@ s and lo@@ op@@ ing those results back , we were able to increase case dete@@ ction rates by over 30 percent .
dr. v : see , mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s &apos; concept is simple .
the school teachers weren &apos;t having much fun , the spor@@ ts were very dir@@ ty or very pain@@ ful .
when i &apos;m on my de@@ ath@@ bed , i &apos;m going to remember one story more than any other .
and one thing led to another , and i ended up having a des@@ k in ? what if ! in new york , when i started independent di@@ pl@@ om@@ at .
but you will need to know ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
you &apos;ve got to sh@@ ine blue light on the kid -- bright blue light on as much of the skin as you can cover .
for example , fe@@ e-@@ b@@ ates , a combin@@ ation of a fe@@ e and a re@@ b@@ ate in any size class of vehicle you want , can increase the price of in@@ efficient vehi@@ cles and cor@@ respon@@ d@@ ingly pay you a re@@ b@@ ate for efficient vehi@@ cles .
it &apos;s the cool@@ est stuff .
so this little ant that &apos;s cra@@ w@@ ling here , it &apos;s like it &apos;s in a little wil@@ ly won@@ ka land .
and there are a lot of other problems with that . it &apos;s very hard to do .
but , being a vagina war@@ ri@@ or , she kept going , and she kept commit@@ ting her@@ self to trans@@ forming consciousness .
so , they got the fra@@ mes from these big bi@@ kes , put them together with the ge@@ ars from the ra@@ cing bi@@ kes , got the bra@@ kes from motor@@ cy@@ cles , and sort of mix@@ ed and mat@@ ched various ingre@@ di@@ ents .
so , i will close with this . these are my older people .
and i started fre@@ a@@ king out , because i don &apos;t know what kind of cra@@ p my grand@@ father was into .
wor@@ r@@ y@@ ingly , there is no con@@ sen@@ su@@ s about what it is .
and this is happening here .
and we can start a film about that , and we can see a little bit back@@ wards in time .
and next you &apos;re going to see the long-@@ lived mu@@ t@@ ant when it &apos;s young .
and then we say , &quot; well how do we line them all up ? &quot;
just to let you know , i do not have a le@@ xi@@ co@@ graphi@@ cal whi@@ st@@ le .
tell people the benefits of education , that &apos;s very cheap to do .
and do you ever say , &quot; no , no i &apos;m not going to . &quot;
and they do that by each year sending out the re@@ produ@@ c@@ tives -- those are the ones with wings -- on a ma@@ ting flight .
and i read it , and it was just -- it was cra@@ p .
and things can happen only if these inter@@ actions are perfectly bal@@ an@@ ced .
fro@@ og@@ le lets you search sh@@ opp@@ ing information , and blog@@ ger lets you publi@@ sh things .
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool .
she was the c@@ bs news cor@@ respon@@ dent who was bru@@ t@@ ally sex@@ ually as@@ sau@@ l@@ ted in eg@@ y@@ pt &apos;s ta@@ hri@@ r square right after this photo was taken .
i didn &apos;t see anyone else . we took this photo next to the heli@@ cop@@ ter .
so i &apos;m going to sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly ex@@ pose something to you , which is beautiful to me .
and to this day rema@@ ins the only je@@ wish di@@ as@@ por@@ a in the history of the je@@ wish people , which has never en@@ counter@@ ed a single inci@@ dent of anti-@@ se@@ mi@@ tis@@ m .
that &apos;s all , shu@@ kr@@ an . thank you very much for the opportunity .
when you eat like a pri@@ mate , you can &apos;t afford both .
and that &apos;s the end .
a single female will lay about up to 100 eg@@ gs at a time , up to about 500 in her lifetime .
we should mer@@ ely report on what repu@@ table par@@ ties have said about it .
it stre@@ t@@ ches about 500 miles , of course it &apos;s india here .
so it was a great experience for him . he sta@@ yed up all night with them , dru@@ mming and dan@@ cing .
this was in an area called well@@ a@@ wat@@ ta , a prime res@@ identi@@ al area in col@@ om@@ bo .
yes , this person reti@@ red at 150 percent of their working income in reti@@ re@@ ment .
extin@@ ction can come slowly , but sometimes it arri@@ ves fast .
this is an approach that has been developed by a couple researchers at dar@@ t@@ mouth medical school , li@@ sa schwar@@ tz and steven w@@ olo@@ sh@@ in .
i don &apos;t know why . i did not ask for a con@@ dom .
and while a student at ha@@ wa@@ ii , i worked at the wa@@ i@@ ki@@ ki a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um .
and he had the best answer i ever heard to this question : &quot; well , somebody has to . &quot;
it &apos;s the path@@ fin@@ der that shows us a simple road through an im@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ able moral ma@@ ze .
and that &apos;s what she does .
imagine : many of these problems could be pre@@ v@@ ented if these babies were just kept warm .
it was just one of those po@@ t-@@ lu@@ ck things where you get it right first time .
you can call yourself responsible , but responsibility without accoun@@ t@@ ability often doesn &apos;t work .
we go back down . it &apos;s going to go up and down .
these disco@@ ver@@ ies of behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers , and behavi@@ oral changes are game changing , and like the discovery of the microscop@@ e because of our colle@@ cting data stre@@ ams that we &apos;ve actually never done before .
it really is .
and that &apos;s not good , for a young married man to go home in a bad mo@@ od .
climate change den@@ i@@ ers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change .
and so we said , right , we &apos;d re@@ defined char@@ ity . we need to re@@ define the way these guys operate . how do we do that ?
your brand starts being dis@@ per@@ sed , it gets more cha@@ o@@ tic .
the mur@@ mu@@ r of the city dis@@ sol@@ ves into a squ@@ all whose chil@@ ling power i no longer feel .
he &apos;s by far the happ@@ i@@ est man ever measu@@ red by science .
i found myself in a hospital in an intensi@@ ve-@@ care ward , re@@ cu@@ per@@ ating from emergen@@ cy surgery .
and because people watch my@@ th@@ bu@@ sters and c@@ s@@ i , i thought , well , let &apos;s put in a reci@@ pe for a bal@@ li@@ stics gel@@ a@@ tin .
&quot; mani@@ a@@ c re@@ ga@@ ined its memory , when the power went off . &quot; &quot; machine or human ? &quot;
when americans go to college and mar@@ ry each other , they have very low di@@ vor@@ ce rates .
so about 10,000 years ago by the black sea , we had one mu@@ tation in one gene which led to blue eyes .
it turns out that something more than 9@@ 4 percent of life on earth is a@@ qua@@ tic .
what we need is new ex@@ it strategi@@ es for argu@@ ments .
so there are two op@@ tions : intelligent design , direct and indi@@ rect -- so god , or my friend .
so let me illu@@ strate that step with a task which is called mental ro@@ tation .
dp : he played &quot; ch@@ op@@ sti@@ cks . &quot; a@@ o : and played &quot; ch@@ op@@ sti@@ cks . &quot;
and so then he put two bri@@ d@@ ges -- this all happened on the fa@@ x , going back and forth over a couple of weeks &apos; period .
at the comm@@ enting area , &#91; it makes &#93; the chinese weib@@ o more like facebook , rather than the original twitter .
first of all , i agree with mu@@ di@@ m@@ be &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; the invention of africa , &quot; that africa is an artificial invention of first col@@ oni@@ alism , and then op@@ posi@@ tional mov@@ ements .
add on pan@@ de@@ mic threat , you &apos;re in big trouble .
using the very first tele@@ phone , wat@@ son was in fact di@@ aled into the hea@@ v@@ ens .
now , being ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ american pres@@ ents its own set of problems , as you know .
only those three words and she left the air@@ port . that &apos;s it .
it just sees this big ballo@@ on in the ocean -- it doesn &apos;t have hands -- it &apos;s going to take a little bi@@ te , the boat po@@ ps , and off they go .
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of a spi@@ der named char@@ lot@@ te , silk is terri@@ fic .
but images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to re@@ mind us of the trage@@ dy of war .
we &apos;re able to draw upon speci@@ alization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
they &apos;re finding out that red@@ wo@@ ods can move mo@@ i@@ st@@ ure out of the air and down into their tr@@ un@@ ks , possibly all the way into their ro@@ ot systems .
so if we can be as good as breast cancer and give women this new charge , we have a lot of lives to save .
somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our fla@@ ws .
can oper@@ a be ever@@ -@@ so-@@ slightly sex@@ y ? the gl@@ ori@@ ous sop@@ ran@@ o dan@@ i@@ elle de ni@@ ese shows how , sing@@ ing the fli@@ r@@ ty &quot; meine li@@ ppen , sie kü@@ ssen so hei@@ ss . &quot; which , transl@@ ated , means , as you might guess : &quot; i k@@ is@@ s so hot . &quot; from gi@@ u@@ di@@ tt@@ a by fr@@ ans le@@ h@@ á@@ r ; ac@@ compan@@ ist : ing@@ rid sur@@ gen@@ or .
and there are , again , now tens of millions of these links that give us the conne@@ ctive tissue of social graph@@ s and how they rel@@ ate to content .
so that &apos;s one thing .
and he &apos;s only been our employe@@ e since janu@@ ary 2005 , all the other growth before that .
ignor@@ e those cre@@ eping fe@@ ars that we have finally hit the wall .
and i remember this one custom@@ er so vi@@ vi@@ dly because i also did some other stuff with these cli@@ ents .
ar@@ iel : i bo@@ ar@@ ded the king &apos;s ship . in every cab@@ in , i fl@@ am@@ ed ama@@ z@@ ement .
the active ingre@@ dient &apos;s res@@ ver@@ at@@ ro@@ l , it &apos;s also found in red wine .
but every musi@@ cian stri@@ kes a different balance between faith and reason , instin@@ ct and intelligence .
he rel@@ ap@@ sed a little bit , they gave him a series of treat@@ ments , and he was essentially cu@@ red .
we became much more social . the social networks exp@@ and@@ ed .
we copy this in the lab by out@@ fit@@ ting cell culture systems with electro@@ des .
or we can zo@@ om out to the table of cont@@ ents , and the video kee@@ ps playing .
because i &apos;m not really comfortable just helping that girl with coun@@ sel@@ ing and refer@@ r@@ als .
take it from me . under the bed is not a good hi@@ ding spot .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
b@@ j : and mi@@ key also has , in his fing@@ ers , the ability to move the tail from left to right , and up and down with the other hand .
we kill using long lines , with ba@@ ited ho@@ o@@ ks every few feet that may stre@@ tch for 50 miles or more .
actually , i come from britain , but i &apos;ve been living in mal@@ di@@ ves for 26 years now .
i just have time to read a more recent po@@ em to you .
i first saw this in a can@@ adi@@ an film board film when i was 10 , and it left a la@@ sting impres@@ sion , to see babies playing with kni@@ ves .
if you go back two billion years , you &apos;re not on an ear@@ th-@@ like planet any more .
but the worst part was , not the spon@@ tane@@ ous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
so , like , ok , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diam@@ ond , or , you know , diag@@ onal .
it was really hot . i was very hun@@ gry .
if you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-@@ law , you &apos;d probably pre@@ fer to stay on the left .
on average , it was just a completely poin@@ t@@ less exchange of money that i would re@@ gre@@ t .
she &apos;s a high school student .
someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; i have to walk my dogs tomorrow . could you come then ? &quot;
you don &apos;t want to tell americans , god for@@ bi@@ d , that they have to change their lifest@@ yle .
it &apos;s about creating with mini@@ mal means something which can not be repe@@ ated , cannot be simul@@ ated in any other sphere .
he wa@@ its three days , and then we to@@ wed in something called the eg@@ g@@ mobile .
now not surpris@@ ingly , that influ@@ enced some people to think we were onto something .
but just looking up with the na@@ ked eye , you really don &apos;t need one .
what she found was many of these stories tend to bl@@ ame vic@@ ti@@ ms and de@@ value their lives .
and down at 100 they would build civili@@ an nuclear energy , which is what they say is their obje@@ ctive .
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ?
and i think that would look quite ne@@ at as an x-@@ ray .
giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how lin@@ ked you are .
but a demo@@ graphic divi@@ den@@ d is only as good as the investment in your human capital .
in biological systems it &apos;s important not to have a whole lot of extra material requi@@ re@@ ments for building it .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insi@@ ghts of con@@ temporary psychology .
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the re@@ ception des@@ k .
every city , coun@@ ty , state did their own thing .
it was a national geographic expedi@@ tion , but it was organized by the explor@@ ers club .
one set of dna goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of dna -- iden@@ tical cop@@ ies of dna .
and the whole thing , if you add it all together , is over six billion nu@@ cle@@ o@@ ti@@ des long .
add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 1@@ 12@@ ,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
it just looks like a sa@@ dd@@ le you &apos;d put on a horse .
and this man with a planet@@ ar@@ y-@@ si@@ zed brain is now ser@@ ving a 13@@ -@@ year sentence in california .
now there &apos;s good reason to believe that you would want to be able to dist@@ ingu@@ ish ex@@ ternal events from intern@@ al events .
you can &apos;t talk about how lon@@ ely having a baby can be .
so we can bring an entirely new tele@@ pres@@ ence to the world , throughout the ocean .
if i have a gps and a camera in my car , i have a pretty pre@@ cise idea of where i am and how fast i &apos;m going .
but i could get a bit dar@@ ker in the tube , but everything else would suff@@ er .
ra@@ pid manufacturing is a computer fi@@ le sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine .
so when you do that , here &apos;s what i can promise : you &apos;re going to be the 800 po@@ und gor@@ ill@@ a in the forest .
how do we deal with our deep@@ est differences , given the human pro@@ pen@@ sity for conflict and the human geni@@ us at de@@ vis@@ ing weapons of enormous destruction ?
this is affected massi@@ vely by rever@@ ber@@ ation time , how rever@@ ber@@ ant a room is .
and just sta@@ ying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really em@@ power@@ ing actually .
so i was trying to , you know , take the engineer &apos;s version : can we build a mechan@@ ical system in in@@ organic materials that will do the same thing ?
we should look at how society and culture in this soci@@ o-@@ cultural regu@@ lation are a work in progress .
and this open-@@ source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly .
then we would generate something all of us would like to have -- a balance between the hunger and the sa@@ ti@@ ation .
i went to not@@ re d@@ ame university and gradu@@ ated with degrees in accoun@@ ting and ger@@ man , including spending a year of study in au@@ stri@@ a .
i went with my friend tim mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , who sat on my left .
and suddenly she sees a t@@ ank am@@ bling down the main road of sar@@ a@@ je@@ vo kno@@ cking everything out of its path .
okay , so we have a democracy , no dou@@ bt , but it &apos;s depen@@ dent upon the le@@ sters and depen@@ dent upon the people .
you we@@ ed down through various steps that cause many of these to fail .
and there was something so beauti@@ fully african about it to me , this small house with a huge heart in it .
if any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
so once those pictures are ac@@ qui@@ red and the physi@@ cian has dra@@ wn all the necessary safety limit@@ s and so on , he sel@@ ec@@ ts basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cur@@ sor is -- and he pres@@ ses this blue butt@@ on called &quot; son@@ ic@@ ate . &quot;
it &apos;s the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating , because the rest of your laptop is de@@ vot@@ ed to itself .
we st@@ um@@ bled on it , looking for some missing heat .
so we got some land that was don@@ ated by a local garden center .
she taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated vagina looked like .
you see the gl@@ aci@@ er flo@@ wing in from the right , dro@@ pping off into the sea , camera sho@@ ot@@ ing every hour .
you just drive to the ne@@ ar@@ est la@@ ke , stick your ho@@ se in it , and you &apos;ve got your car filled up .
and i will try and give you a sense of what the ulti@@ mate re@@ boot looks like .
help with the mass per@@ su@@ asi@@ on campaign that will start this spring .
this is a state diagra@@ m . that &apos;s an extremely simple computer .
the british government -- any government is poten@@ tially the worst cli@@ ent in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
in about the first billi@@ on@@ th of a second or so , the hig@@ gs field ki@@ cked in , and the quar@@ ks and the gl@@ u@@ ons and the electr@@ ons that make us up got mass .
we &apos;re very co-@@ evolved , because we dep@@ end on bees for pol@@ lin@@ ation and , even more recently , as an economic com@@ modi@@ ty .
don &apos;t black@@ -@@ box history . don &apos;t check your principles at the door .
he &apos;s a tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil that we found with a large tumor on his face .
and is it easy to raise that money ?
at serious play 2008 , astro@@ physi@@ c@@ ist george smo@@ ot shows stun@@ ning new images from deep@@ -@@ space sur@@ ve@@ ys , and pro@@ ds us to pon@@ der how the co@@ smo@@ s -- with its giant we@@ bs of dark matter and myster@@ i@@ ous g@@ ap@@ ing vo@@ ids -- got built this way .
and i ended up with a plastic nose , por@@ cel@@ a@@ in teeth and all kinds of other things .
and we did that for tens of thousands of neurons , built digital models of all the different types of neurons we came across .
darwin said , &quot; i have never been an athei@@ st in the same sense of den@@ ying the existence of a god .
the z@@ ones of production and distribution tend to lie in the developing world , and they are often thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by app@@ all@@ ing violence and b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed .
he said , &quot; ok . i measu@@ red the hei@@ ght of a bri@@ ck .
let me be very clear , and perhaps contro@@ versi@@ al , that open government is not about transpar@@ ent government .
and this is a rain@@ y ele@@ ction day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
and the cla@@ im was fish oil p@@ ills improve school performance and behavior in main@@ stream children .
this comes across also in the way in which religi@@ ons set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
actually , we found 100 percent is easier to do than 90 percent or 50 percent .
and ni@@ ke knows how to get your p@@ ace and distance from just that sen@@ sor .
i began to be very dis@@ interested in computers themselves , so i began to make pain@@ t@@ ings out of pal@@ mp@@ il@@ ots .
when i turned 18 , i lost my best friend to a car accident .
that &apos;s not dir@@ ty enough . let &apos;s just sti@@ r that up a little bit .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
if you think that way , you have a plat@@ on@@ ist moral frame@@ work .
and that set me on this pan@@ ic driven search for the perfect language method .
a public place so dis@@ mal that the win@@ os don &apos;t even want to go there .
don &apos;t you think that on a pur@@ ely commercial level , that anti-@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs are great adverti@@ se@@ ments for western in@@ genu@@ ity and technology ?
well , to do that , one thing is we can look at the de@@ cep@@ tion@@ -@@ dete@@ ction liter@@ ature .
and so imagine one more thing : that that software is able to ask both par@@ ties for mu@@ tual con@@ s@@ ents , &quot; would you be willing to meet your third cou@@ sin ? &quot;
she@@ en@@ a i@@ y@@ en@@ gar studies how we make choices -- and how we feel about the choices we make . at ted@@ global , she talks about both tri@@ vi@@ al choices and profound ones , and shares her gro@@ und@@ breaking research that has un@@ covered some surprising at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des about our decisions .
but -- and this is the dark lin@@ ing -- it is thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed by -- in the same way that it thre@@ at@@ ens -- the in@@ cum@@ b@@ ent industrial systems .
if we can make it through the next 150 years , i think that your great great grand@@ children will forget all about mal@@ th@@ us .
not all of them have been perfect , or will be , but the trend is very clear .
invest .
and the ship sin@@ ks , and the cap@@ tain has lost everything , but for a life jac@@ ket .
it &apos;s why social organization has grown from the h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er village to the ancient state , the em@@ pi@@ re , and now here we are in a glob@@ alized world .
and that &apos;s fortun@@ ate , because we can put two electro@@ des on your pal@@ m and measure the change in skin resi@@ stance produced by swe@@ ating .
we want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circum@@ stances .
i know a 14@@ -year-old girl in the ne@@ ther@@ lands , for example , who is dem@@ and@@ ing that she take a boat and go around the entire world by her@@ self .
look at hom@@ i@@ cide at the bottom , for god &apos;s sa@@ ke .
i was coming at it from a different perspective , where i was bringing that different perspective to bear on the problem .
mu@@ d and miner@@ als become sub@@ strate ; there are bacteria .
for some reason , there &apos;s no standard sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us , there &apos;s no basic course .
people need to know the har@@ m that institutions cause to children , and the better alterna@@ tives that exist .
many people have la@@ id down their lives for commun@@ ism , and many have la@@ id down their lives for capit@@ alism .
now , the activi@@ ties from the lab have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean .
and the key detail of this is that fe@@ y &apos;s scri@@ p@@ ts weren &apos;t written by her and they weren &apos;t written by the s@@ n@@ l wri@@ ters .
it was 25 minutes of absolute ter@@ ror that thousands of people across the u.s. felt .
this is a ma@@ p@@ ni@@ fi@@ cent map that shows me , in this case , how far i can get from my home in 30 minutes using public transpor@@ tation .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely ten photos per photograph@@ er , is a lie .
the one thing though that is really dangerous about these sorts of technologies , is that it &apos;s easy to become se@@ duced by them .
so , i went to talk to a doctor friend , and i asked him how could i do that ?
there are also some children who are born without arms , called con@@ gen@@ ital lim@@ b de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ency .
and look , there &apos;s now 1@@ 1.@@ 2 percent more clou@@ ds -- already , after three years .
i mean , this is literally human beings with super@@ -@@ human strength and abilities .
you should not be s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , who roll@@ s a rock up a mountain all day only to find the b@@ ou@@ l@@ der roll@@ ed down at night .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that j@@ as@@ on has illu@@ strated .
and he says , &quot; oh my god , my phan@@ tom is moving again . i don &apos;t believe this !
it didn &apos;t change its economy . it didn &apos;t change the com@@ posi@@ tions of its population .
see , he ow@@ ned a chro@@ mi@@ um pl@@ ating company , and they had to move heavy steel parts between tan@@ ks of chemicals , and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy li@@ f@@ ting .
repor@@ ter : isra@@ el@@ i bor@@ der police were sent to dis@@ per@@ se the crowd .
so , i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fo@@ w@@ ler apple is still out there .
and equ@@ ally , he &apos;d have been surprised that he was acting under orders from mar@@ du@@ k .
i don &apos;t understand why the media is focused on eastern pen@@ n@@ syl@@ v@@ ania .
very advanced , no air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing -- i love it .
perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our el@@ der@@ ly are obje@@ c@@ tively less useful than in traditional societies .
death : go to i@@ fi@@ die@@ .@@ net before it &apos;s too late .
so this is actually the first time we &apos;ve ever done live audience feedback to a performance .
to give you an idea of how slowly , it had about 1@@ k of memory .
anyway . so i &apos;m going to jump ahead .
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x looks like in my living room .
but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits .
it wasn &apos;t really a research report ; it was a scre@@ ed .
here &apos;s a clip from a national geographic movie that came out in 199@@ 9 .
we need a nas@@ a-@@ like organization for ocean exploration , because we need to be explor@@ ing and prote@@ cting our life support systems here on earth .
you could drop an at@@ om bom@@ b on a city , and 30 years later it &apos;s survi@@ ving .
this is what i tend to see almost more than con@@ tradi@@ ctions .
and this is exactly the symbol of our world .
i think this is what we come with , at least a prepar@@ e@@ dness to learn all of these things .
and interest@@ ingly , as i think back , they were the first true environ@@ ment@@ alists .
why would you do that ? why would -- it &apos;s like one step up from re@@ pl@@ ying to one of those e@@ mails from nigeria , isn &apos;t it ?
we make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual inter@@ ro@@ gation .
and what that means is that we origin@@ ated in africa . it &apos;s written in our dna .
i want you just for a second to experience this amazing human sym@@ ph@@ ony .
so the engineer &apos;s bo@@ ss said , &quot; find a way to quie@@ t this train . &quot;
building capac@@ i@@ ties for the young generation is going to make a better generation and a better future tomorrow for africa .
so we took a hundred dollar bill and divi@@ ded it into 10,000 teen@@ y pieces , and we f@@ ed those into the mechan@@ ical tur@@ k .
so , yeah .
all of us , to some ex@@ tent , study this thing called a bill gates .
all i &apos;m saying is -- facts . facts only .
why do people succe@@ ed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? nei@@ ther . analy@@ st richard st@@ . john con@@ den@@ ses years of intervie@@ ws into an un@@ miss@@ able 3@@ -@@ minute sli@@ des@@ how on the real secre@@ ts of success .
and what these images are -- you &apos;ll see them at the start of the slide show -- there &apos;s only about four images -- but it &apos;s of a little bear that lives in the great bear rain@@ forest .
so if you &apos;ve sent three spec@@ im@@ ens , it &apos;s an hour later .
but i &apos;m not going to change anything within those bo@@ xes , except their meaning .
it doesn &apos;t matter if this is the jun@@ gles of sing@@ apo@@ re or the tun@@ dr@@ a of northern fin@@ land .
they were doing an experiment to do with gene@@ tics and the for@@ eli@@ m@@ bs and the h@@ ind lim@@ bs of animals .
all right ? now one thing about art is , art is discovery , and art is disco@@ vering yourself through your art . right ?
and most surpris@@ ingly to me , they sometimes can even see eye to eye on crimin@@ al justice .
what we find out now is that it &apos;s probably coming from inside the earth .
and i fir@@ m@@ ly believe that in the next 10 years tumor tre@@ ating fields will be a wea@@ pon available to doctors and patients for all of these mo@@ st-@@ diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ treat soli@@ d tumor@@ s .
they &apos;re trained to be more re@@ stra@@ ined in the use of force than the military are .
but think of what it does to how we think in traditional terms and concep@@ ts .
i actually suggest@@ ed to -- there is a resear@@ cher at the university of al@@ ab@@ ama who does or@@ gas@@ m research .
and when that cell@@ ular space station is within the electric field , it acts on those highly char@@ ged proteins and al@@ ig@@ ns them .
i &apos;m going to go over some science experiments and try to cover three musical experiments .
it &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate that they tend to be sel@@ ec@@ tively de@@ plo@@ yed .
and when you look through them , you get a gli@@ mp@@ se into the mind of the cyber@@ -@@ illu@@ sion@@ ist .
the camera is actually not only understanding your hand mov@@ ements , but , interest@@ ingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
some of these have already been tou@@ ched upon by other speak@@ ers , which is encoura@@ ging .
we focused on a business model ; we insi@@ sted on skin in the game .
i built the head . they built the body .
and there &apos;s a lot of evidence that neu@@ ral activity is en@@ co@@ ding our thoughts , feelings and per@@ cep@@ tions , our mental experiences .
so then he surprised the nation with an up@@ set vic@@ tory for the pres@@ iden@@ cy over three far more experienced , far more educ@@ ated , far more cele@@ br@@ ated ri@@ v@@ als .
we started with a motor with a little le@@ ver , a little force trans@@ f@@ user .
the question was , where from ?
and the most remarkable fe@@ at is that my hand actually sta@@ yed still long enough to do that .
now do we really want to com@@ mit ourselves to eng@@ ul@@ fing all the other religi@@ ons when their hol@@ y books are telling them , &quot; don &apos;t listen to the other side , that &apos;s just sat@@ an talking ! &quot;
and the dri@@ ll ser@@ ge@@ ant starts scre@@ aming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
and now to introdu@@ ce their music video , we have ok go .
but again i would say that this is our moment for extraordinary things to happen .
and this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
&quot; we don &apos;t care about being happy . we need to live with passion .
and so everyone can be at least happy to see a shift from coal or oil to natural gas .
and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
i learned that she did not have to be ab@@ used because she is a woman .
that is , they &apos;re meaning@@ less without context : 500 billion for this pi@@ p@@ eline , 20 billion for this war .
i &apos;m looking for a third way : i &apos;m prepar@@ ing to get alzheimer &apos;s disease .
maybe 100,000 people have co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants , which allow them to hear .
it allows for us to celebra@@ te the se@@ af@@ o@@ od that we &apos;re also so fortun@@ ate to eat .
it &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the stri@@ p across the street .
that &apos;s kind of ridi@@ cul@@ ous . it &apos;s a total de@@ co@@ y .
first , no real spor@@ ts fan would talk that way .
right ? so they can go online and contribu@@ te ideas on what that region would look like by the year 20@@ 20 .
and then you make it easy and give a reason to act now by ad@@ ding a kil@@ o of l@@ enti@@ ls for each imm@@ uni@@ zation .
it &apos;s ris@@ ky and it &apos;s going to be one hell of a ride -- better than dis@@ ney .
then i tried typ@@ ing words on my laptop and using its built in voice .
in short , we ad@@ mi@@ re their will@@ ing@@ ness to play .
i was sent to a place , a psy@@ ch ward , and in the psy@@ ch ward , everyone is doing their own one-@@ man show .
and stop with the lab@@ els , the limit@@ ing .
the thing is , if we don &apos;t know whether we are doing any good , we are not any better than the medi@@ ev@@ al doctors and their le@@ e@@ ches .
and there are a lot of fun things . this is the museum of the ben@@ ch .
we become dic@@ tat@@ ors with a remote and start to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ze the people on tv .
so , at the center there , that &apos;s actually where most of the star@@ light comes out from .
and i can talk about it all day -- just ask my wife -- but i want to move on to something that &apos;s kind of much more interesting .
and everybody there agre@@ ed this woman was very sick and she needed to be in the hospital .
but this , sur@@ ely , who@@ ever that man is , whatever he &apos;s done , this is cru@@ el and unusual pun@@ ish@@ ment .
if you could do all of them , you would have a very pre@@ cise theory .
as a test case , i pro@@ pose we start with american dan@@ cers .
now , i think there are lessons we should learn here , lessons about open@@ ness .
i have days that i believe , but i have days that i &apos;m full of dou@@ bt .
they are acting in the sense that they &apos;re em@@ ul@@ ating the original ma@@ sh@@ up .
this much , right ?
one or both , who knows ? or it could be something completely different .
my brain started telling me , jan@@ e , you want to die .
as you can see , a project evol@@ ves through a series of generations of design meetings .
i &apos;m going to look quickly at the fourth and fif@@ th categ@@ ories , which are innovation , competi@@ tions and social invest@@ ing .
that &apos;s an experience that not every other musli@@ m nation in the middle east had until very recently .
but there &apos;s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
it &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever en@@ counter@@ ed eu@@ cli@@ de@@ an space .
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day .
i want to show you some moments of history in my journey , which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world .
this is still the way we &apos;re communic@@ ating mes@@ sages about health .
now what &apos;s interesting about that is ir@@ regular ver@@ bs between al@@ fre@@ d and ja@@ y-@@ z have become more regular .
if you look down , you can &apos;t see your feet .
like if we had a piece of ta@@ pe now , we &apos;d pe@@ el it this way .
well , what i did with that was to access the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stics liter@@ ature .
you &apos;re going to design something like a cell phone , and in a high-@@ level language , you &apos;ll describe that cell phone .
&quot; i want to look like this . this is how i looked before . &quot;
and this word here , george bush called this war a cr@@ us@@ ade .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can r@@ ent it out .
i cont@@ ac@@ ted a company in the states who make su@@ its for nasa .
we have pre-@@ can@@ cer@@ ous les@@ i@@ ons , which often don &apos;t turn into cancer .
we &apos;ve actually kind of made an eth@@ ical choice in society to not have coral re@@ ef@@ s .
life is a right , not coll@@ at@@ er@@ al or cas@@ ual .
we basically are taking the same satelli@@ te phone parts , or the same parts that are in your computer , chi@@ ps .
it turns out to have a fore@@ brain one-@@ fif@@ te@@ ent@@ h the size of a human .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friend@@ ly he was getting .
and then we wonder why the mem@@ bran@@ e clo@@ gs and why it takes so much electricity .
i would per@@ c@@ uss the ch@@ est . i would listen to the heart .
it &apos;s about roll@@ ing a ball and pi@@ cking up as many objects as you can in a fin@@ ite amount of time and hopefully you &apos;ll be able to make it into a planet .
i &apos;ll spend a fortun@@ e on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea .
there is no change in blood flow , in di@@ lat@@ ation of the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
there &apos;s an old cell@@ phone in there -- a good use for old cell@@ phones -- which di@@ als the clin@@ ic , we go and pick up the mouse .
so it was a big commit@@ ment to drive to the lab to work multiple times .
you become your nation . you become your religion .
so , what do you think ?
it &apos;s only relative to conscious ag@@ ents that a piece of paper is money or that a bunch of buildings is a university .
you all know that . at the last i@@ p@@ c@@ c sum@@ mary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; how certain are you ? &quot; they wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a sc@@ ore@@ board li@@ ft .
and the world certainly does not need the largest tox@@ ic im@@ po@@ und@@ ments to grow and multi@@ p@@ ly and further thre@@ aten the down@@ stream communities .
the l@@ x@@ d electri@@ fy the ted@@ 2010 stage with an emerging global stre@@ et@@ -@@ dance culture , re@@ v@@ ved up by the internet . in a pre@@ view of j@@ on ch@@ u &apos;s up@@ coming web series , this ast@@ on@@ ishing trou@@ pe show off their super@@ power@@ s .
in fact , growing up in tas@@ man@@ ia , it always was incredibly exciting when we got a chance to see a tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil in the wild .
if this does not b@@ low your mind , then you have no emotion .
so it rema@@ ins for me to com@@ ment on the ways in which chimpanze@@ es are so like us , in certain aspe@@ cts of their behavior .
we have now found treat@@ ments for nearly all of the tens of thousands of conditions that a human being can have .
but again , i can only affect society and affect government if i bring out the hard core evidence .
if this idea is truly sound , then the impli@@ cations are significant .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples of how per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve this phenomen@@ a is .
at the top of the she@@ et , we had little diagra@@ ms of how do you fold origami .
they put 2@@ 5,000 she@@ ep in one flo@@ ck , really mi@@ mi@@ cking nature now with plan@@ ned gra@@ zing , and they have docum@@ ented a 5@@ 0-@@ percent increase in the production of the land in the first year .
i &apos;ve been told by the revolution of military aff@@ air@@ s crowd for years , we can do it faster , che@@ aper , smaller , just as le@@ th@@ al .
and in about 199@@ 7 , the th@@ en-@@ director phili@@ ppe de mon@@ te@@ b@@ ell@@ o gave me the go@@ -@@ ahead to organi@@ ze an exhi@@ bi@@ tion for 200@@ 2 . we normally have these very long le@@ ad@@ -@@ in times .
if you look into their traditional systems , afri@@ cans organi@@ ze their states in two types .
it &apos;s the 24@@ -@@ hour roll@@ ing african news chan@@ nel .
these are complex things built with complex parts that come together in complex ways .
they don &apos;t come back several times , so it really chron@@ ic@@ les a journey .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m d@@ ressed as bat@@ man to hi@@ de my identity . &quot;
first , it &apos;s clearly a non-@@ invasi@@ ve , wir@@ eless form of communication .
i have a few of them -- they &apos;re no more than a minute or a min@@ u@@ te@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half ap@@ ie@@ ce -- but i thought you might be interested in seeing some of our work over the last year , and how it respon@@ ds in video .
i sort of forget how bizar@@ re some of those conver@@ sa@@ tions are .
so i went home , i got a training di@@ ary out , and i had a plan .
and the local finan@@ cing is not part of the ecosystem for suppor@@ ting hard@@ ware projects .
ben@@ evol@@ ence , lo@@ ving kin@@ dness against hat@@ red .
when the ice was flat or fl@@ at@@ tish , i could just about pull both .
that &apos;s all great , right ?
i become the medium through which the music is being chan@@ nel@@ ed , and in the process , when all is right , the music is trans@@ formed and so am i .
only 90 days after this , argu@@ ably the greatest discovery of the last century occur@@ red .
in the southern he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere there are impact cr@@ at@@ ers , there are vol@@ can@@ ic cr@@ at@@ ers .
a change in commit@@ ment . a new sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy .
there are other par@@ as@@ ites that do this -- which ren@@ der the ho@@ st ster@@ i@@ le .
s@@ mil@@ ing can help reduce the level of st@@ res@@ s-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like cor@@ ti@@ so@@ l , ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine and dop@@ am@@ ine , increase the level of mo@@ o@@ d-@@ en@@ han@@ cing hor@@ mon@@ es like end@@ or@@ ph@@ in and reduce over@@ all blood pressure .
dy@@ sle@@ x@@ ic , so i &apos;m a bit slow .
the first one is , you can change from what i call a &#91; vi@@ cious &#93; circle to a virtual circle .
in effect , when we give cancer patients anti@@ angiogen@@ ic therapy -- here , an experiment@@ al drug for a gli@@ om@@ a , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dra@@ matic changes that occu@@ r when the tumor is being star@@ ved .
and this is why our species has pro@@ sper@@ ed around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind b@@ ars in zo@@ os , langu@@ ishing .
and when you exp@@ and their pal@@ ates , you exp@@ and their vo@@ cab@@ ul@@ ary .
i really believe that old tru@@ man line , that if you give the american people the facts , they &apos;ll do the right thing .
great news . it dri@@ ves me nu@@ ts that most people don &apos;t seem to know this news .
the chinese have a very , very different con@@ ception of race to most other countries .
what he did was to get wild birds to make his art for him .
the future of life , where the un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing of our biology -- and bring up the lights a little bit . i don &apos;t have any sli@@ des .
you might think these are people with master &apos;s degrees .
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ?
there are now 22 cities that have veter@@ ans &apos; cour@@ ts like this .
so that meant she was in@@ continent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wa@@ stes .
he said , if i want to describe one more force , maybe i need one more dimension .
think of it as a massive it@@ un@@ es for book type content .
standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embra@@ cing violence .
second of all , it &apos;s really beauti@@ fully bal@@ an@@ ced : it hol@@ ds well , it feels well .
and this is the con@@ version of one group of sub@@ stances into another , either through the production or the absor@@ ption of energy .
we have so much technology no@@ wa@@ days that these inter@@ faces should start con@@ forming to us .
people wrote in for re@@ prin@@ ts of that thing .
the pilot light inside of me was still a light , just as it is in each and every one of us .
and as i move my hand , i can pop the ballo@@ ons or i can move the bu@@ g .
but looking around the world at the diversity of humans , he said , &quot; well , you know , we seem to come in dis@@ cre@@ et sub-@@ species or categ@@ ories . &quot;
and despite all of our best eff@@ or@@ ts and inten@@ tions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
of more conc@@ ern , i think , is the astero@@ ids that exist between mars and ju@@ pit@@ er .
and you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- deta@@ ched from the instrument and from the stick , even though i &apos;m actually holding the stick quite ti@@ ghtly .
w@@ k : yeah , i want to build another one -- to pu@@ mp water and ir@@ ri@@ gation for cro@@ ps .
and you don &apos;t necessarily have the sense that twitter is in fact a very hea@@ vi@@ ly brazi@@ li@@ an space .
and the idea that you could see things inside of a cr@@ y@@ st@@ al ball and predict the future -- or a television set , where it &apos;s sort of like a magic box where anything can appear .
so with that in mind , this particular inci@@ dent has led to the things that i &apos;m working on now .
we &apos;ve seen it in the financial crisis . we &apos;ve seen it in the pan@@ de@@ mic flu .
social media didn &apos;t create the revolution ; it was created by a new generation of young people who wanted jobs and hope and who didn &apos;t want to be treated as subje@@ cts anymore .
ide@@ ally you want to put the head support in the cr@@ ani@@ al area , right there .
the talk will be broad@@ ly about energy , but oil &apos;s a good place to start .
one of my favorite parts of my job at the gates foundation is that i get to travel to the developing world , and i do that quite regul@@ arly .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed all over the world in the last two and a half years -- i went to about 12 different countries .
we need change even working with individual companies is not probably going to get us there .
and i@@ van puts his sandwi@@ ch over here , on top of the pi@@ rate ch@@ est .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depen@@ ds on the planet ?
so we &apos;ve designed products and we analy@@ zed chemicals down to the parts per million .
the good news , it &apos;s not cancer , it &apos;s not tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is , it &apos;s not co@@ c@@ ci@@ dio@@ i@@ dom@@ y@@ co@@ sis or some ob@@ sc@@ ure f@@ ung@@ al infe@@ ction .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
and ug@@ ly face is this -- when you go fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with a pu@@ pp@@ y or a child , you say , &quot; what are you doing ! now stop it , stop it , stop it ! &quot;
they su@@ ck up all the water , keep to themselves , and they dri@@ p feed the lower city .
and then you do the ritual dan@@ ces that em@@ power the cros@@ ses .
a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and land@@ ed .
so the idea there was that one must be able to -- how do you say ? -- model price vari@@ ation .
sh@@ ame feels the same for men and women , but it &apos;s organized by gender .
but i would come back from those di@@ ves and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate to the task .
now , the conven@@ tional wisdom was that nigeri@@ ans don &apos;t read liter@@ ature .
but this did not solve the big problem i had with en@@ r@@ on yet , because in en@@ r@@ on , there &apos;s also a social element .
david bis@@ mark demo@@ s a new system for vot@@ ing that con@@ tains a simple , ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able way to prevent fr@@ au@@ d and mis@@ coun@@ ting -- while keeping each person &apos;s vote secret .
well , if poor old su@@ ki is in search of a mate , what would su@@ ki do to find the perfect mate ?
we also see sharks , much more regul@@ arly than i would have expected to .
that is something to keep in mind . we can &apos;t deal with it with situations like this .
on dec@@ ember 2@@ 9@@ th , u.s. tro@@ ops surro@@ unded a si@@ ou@@ x en@@ cam@@ pment at wo@@ unded k@@ nee cre@@ ek and mas@@ sac@@ red ch@@ ie@@ f big foot and 300 pris@@ on@@ ers of war , using a new rapi@@ d-@@ fire wea@@ pon that fi@@ red explo@@ ding sh@@ ells called a hot@@ ch@@ k@@ is@@ s gun .
but we have a new hope . we have a new man .
but we were expected to have dou@@ b@@ ts ; we &apos;re expected to have fe@@ ars .
and one thing that sho@@ cked me is one day they brought an arab musi@@ cian to come and enter@@ tain the soldiers .
so , examples like christ@@ op@@ her wr@@ en &apos;s king &apos;s cross : you can see that the struc@@ tural forces of the v@@ au@@ l@@ ting get artic@@ ul@@ ated as lines , so you &apos;re really actually seeing the expression of struc@@ tural force and form .
it &apos;s about your const@@ it@@ u@@ en@@ cies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
he would tell you , as he told me , &quot; i asked myself , &quot; he said , &quot; what did my grand@@ parents and my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents do to protect the forest for me ?
so they eventually started mat@@ ching their tal@@ ents and skills to all of my needs .
it &apos;s based on an ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ an rhyth@@ m called &quot; car@@ ni@@ v@@ ali@@ to . &quot;
so somebody says , &quot; d@@ ele@@ te it , please . d@@ ele@@ te it -- it &apos;s not not@@ able . &quot;
i hope there aren &apos;t any sna@@ il rights activi@@ sts around here .
this is a room full of intelligent people , highly sensitive .
i knew him once , but then he was a boy .
but a few kids are sad and blue because they &apos;ve for@@ gotten their co@@ at .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
this is a be@@ e &apos;s leg with the pollen gl@@ om@@ med onto it from a mal@@ low plant .
it was , inci@@ dent@@ ally , the last time i ever saw da@@ y@@ light .
but we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
as you can see on this map , russi@@ a is still the largest country in the world .
well how many clou@@ d@@ less sk@@ ies do you think there were above central europe between 19@@ 40 and 19@@ 45 ?
and that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21@@ st of september as the date of peace .
and because of that , we &apos;ve been able to show that there is a super@@ massive black hole there .
many of you , i think , have probably tre@@ k@@ ked here .
so half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she liked the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i -- just like a baby and any other san@@ e person .
i &apos;ve been ban@@ ging on about this like i can &apos;t believe .
now we have diver@@ gen@@ ce over time , but we &apos;ve created the third dimension of area .
and somewhere in the middle of south da@@ k@@ ota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
i said , &quot; do you pra@@ y ? &quot;
ju@@ dge opportunity by how few other students and researchers are on hand .
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vac@@ u@@ um , you know .
pretty clever , right ?
too many with@@ dra@@ w@@ als from the carbon bank , and so this population will be shu@@ t down .
oxygen , hydro@@ gen and zin@@ c have their own sig@@ nature .
and perhaps a black bear walked by . and maybe na@@ tive americans were there .
we went -- i went to 100 , 200 ce@@ os , c@@ mo@@ s .
but over@@ thro@@ wing a government is one thing and building a stable democracy is a bit more complicated .
if you don &apos;t like the subject or the performance , you can hold the red .
i was thinking about making my own little rock@@ ets .
you know that , right ?
getting closer to sh@@ ore , where we are , this was in fact taken in the gala@@ pa@@ gos .
this was after 9 / 11 ; the city was in tough times .
and it &apos;s a respon@@ sive system that &apos;s trained on actual weather .
i actually just as@@ sm@@ ed the path@@ ologi@@ c sequence of events was sett@@ led science .
but sometimes it &apos;s as though a do@@ or@@ way appe@@ ars from out of no@@ where and it op@@ ens onto a sta@@ ir@@ case .
and it was also inspired by this quote from dou@@ glas ad@@ ams , and the situation is from &quot; the hit@@ ch@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s gui@@ de to the galaxy . &quot;
we use the sub@@ marine al@@ v@@ in and we use c@@ ameras , and the c@@ ameras are something that bill lange has developed with the help of son@@ y .
i &apos;m working to try and break down that sense of that eli@@ tis@@ m .
but if someone started off saying , &quot; my average li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of suffering from cancer is about 10 percent , &quot; and we said , &quot; hey , bad news .
and it &apos;s depen@@ dent on passi@@ ve patients who just take it and don &apos;t ask any questions .
it la@@ sts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium .
how did we become the only species that becomes more pro@@ sper@@ ous as it becomes more popul@@ ous ?
like , this is vi@@ a@@ gr@@ a that i bought from a back@@ street sex shop in china .
they may have a lot of opini@@ ons about it , but they &apos;re not going to be terri@@ bly in@@ formed .
but better -- what is more important is that they would have to concent@@ rate sun@@ light .
she said , &quot; well , i work for a company called he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pac@@ k@@ ard . &quot;
and you can see these large , yo@@ l@@ ke@@ d-@@ up eg@@ gs bur@@ sting through the surface of this male &apos;s te@@ stes .
i think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , my first conf@@ ession -- to a base@@ ball@@ -@@ lo@@ ving pri@@ est !
but also what &apos;s important is that they &apos;re not sl@@ ac@@ ker , la@@ zy fish .
and there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipu@@ lations than young men .
and i as@@ sure you it &apos;s every bit as important to them as it might have been to col@@ oni@@ z@@ ers and im@@ peri@@ alists .
an architect far better and smar@@ ter than us has given us that to@@ ol@@ box , and we now have the ability to use it .
and i looked at it bene@@ ath the microscop@@ e . and some of it was flat .
they are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more part@@ ners than straight people on the party scene .
the first one is de@@ dic@@ ated to spen@@ cer , and his grandmother , who was sho@@ cked by his work .
decided to use recycl@@ ed content from c@@ ement and steel manufacturing .
i tend to win those argu@@ ments , because i know the tricks .
and i &apos;ll just say what i &apos;m about to do . what i &apos;m about to do -- i hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a di@@ stor@@ ted s@@ ine wave , almost a tri@@ ang@@ ular wave upon this he@@ w@@ le@@ tt@@ -@@ pac@@ k@@ ard o@@ sc@@ il@@ lo@@ scop@@ e .
or like k@@ ant , did i use reason to figure out what was in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally right ? &quot;
now , it turns out we only kill the female mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es .
but later the government soldiers began mi@@ stre@@ ating us a lot .
but we knew we really needed the right person to kind of r@@ ally behind and build something for .
well , today , i &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respe@@ cts .
and i &apos;m certainly looking forward with im@@ men@@ se exc@@ it@@ ement to it being turned on .
and then finally ...
he didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be ar@@ re@@ sted , so he supp@@ lied everybody with this fa@@ ke volunte@@ er card .
when e@@ dis@@ on invented the light bul@@ b , pretty much looked like this .
its early version had an &quot; x &quot; base . that &apos;s what the colle@@ c@@ tors like .
so massive , in fact , that it can con@@ tain all the other military bud@@ gets in the world inside itself .
actually , that photo was pa@@ sted in a police station , and what you see on the ground are id cards of all the photos of people being tra@@ cked by the police .
and at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets .
right .
each one is formed by one fairly cheap die set , instead of four expensive ones for stam@@ ping steel .
no .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
thanks .
&#91; &quot; o@@ edi@@ pus re@@ x &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the li@@ on king &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; ti@@ tus &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; fri@@ da &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; the magic fl@@ ute &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; across the universe &quot; &#93; j@@ ul@@ ie ta@@ y@@ mor : thank you . thank you very much .
because one of her favorite folks from back home is here , and she &apos;s pretty nervous to meet him .
you &apos;re walking to make us feel bad . &quot;
and i actually feel at home here , because there &apos;s a lot of autis@@ m gene@@ tics here .
with every picture , there are individuals who have full lives and stories that deser@@ ve to be told .
last .
we have se@@ cul@@ ari@@ zed b@@ ad@@ ly , i would argue .
so , i &apos;ve no time to go into all the different scientific results .
you need to know that the average patent tro@@ ll defen@@ se costs two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
she works for a very big company , a work@@ shop in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , making fur@@ ni@@ tures .
i was lying on a thin , hard spin@@ al bed .
oh .
well actually , i &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whi@@ st@@ ling since the age of four , about four .
p@@ m : and we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave .
after a while of reading this in the news , it just becomes news .
okay .
ok .
so we &apos;re getting feedback from teachers at the school to see what kind of app@@ s they &apos;d like .
when she was 10 years old in 19@@ 27 , she published her first book of po@@ em@@ s called &quot; the jan@@ it@@ or &apos;s boy . &quot;
this is the term that ar@@ mi@@ es use when they &apos;ve lost a battle .
every now and then , when they clim@@ b on top of the ball , they wi@@ pe their face .
he believed that the cr@@ y@@ st@@ al was the model for all kinds of repres@@ entation .
case in point : when &quot; the su@@ l@@ tan &apos;s eleph@@ ant &quot; came to london just nine months after 7 / 7 , a lon@@ don@@ er wrote , &quot; for the first time since the london bom@@ b@@ ings , my daughter called up with that spar@@ kle back in her voice .
that actually occur@@ red this year . she took early reti@@ re@@ ment .
it &apos;s really cold ; it &apos;s 24@@ ,000 feet .
but if i come up really close and st@@ are directly at the camera on this laptop then you &apos;ll see these nice cris@@ p eyes .
this i found , where nature had made a picture for me .
it really should be called the re@@ co@@ very or return of asia .
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually fe@@ asi@@ ble .
yeah .
yeah .
yes .
if you have er@@ r@@ ors , you can replace a part .
if you don &apos;t say the right creative thing , you &apos;re going to be jud@@ ged .
look at them first . look at them first .
there are no pat@@ ents . anyone can make it .
and then the government sat on it and used it for political le@@ verage on mo@@ i , who was the rich@@ est man -- still is the rich@@ est man -- in kenya .
not something you &apos;d en@@ vy or want to do .
and what you can see is it &apos;s very non-@@ uni@@ form . you see a lot more structure there .
the system meas@@ ures the be@@ am &apos;s time of flight , recor@@ ding the time it takes for the light to hit a surface and make its return .
you go in along the sh@@ ore , you can find it everywhere .
now , as@@ ca@@ p said they didn &apos;t care .
a few of these . this is a@@ ti@@ ll@@ a the hen .
and so they invented the scientific journ@@ al as a way of syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zing the argument across the community of natural scientists .
you have to study vision with the reali@@ zation of how the movement system is going to use vision .
secon@@ dly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mi@@ ce ?
i &apos;m an ec@@ ologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity .
&quot; it &apos;d be like putting a piece of to@@ ast through a bas@@ ket@@ ball ho@@ op , wouldn &apos;t it ? &quot;
i think it &apos;s time that we transi@@ tioned to a solar syste@@ m-@@ going civilization and species .
it could have been den@@ ti@@ stry , but the word &quot; experiment@@ al &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what i had to go for .
but it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways .
if you go into a restaurant and you have bad custom@@ er service , show them what bad custom@@ er service looks like .
and she came into town and she rus@@ hed around and she said , &quot; i have to buy some new shoes ! &quot;
e@@ ars are made not for hearing , but for listening .
while he was doing this , he noticed an un@@ expected thing .
i was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
and i think because early on , frank@@ ly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
green is the sort of cool areas where it &apos;s not turned on .
this is the market leader in mal@@ ware distribution , the black hole explo@@ it pack , responsible for nearly one third of mal@@ ware distribution in the last couple of quar@@ ters .
it &apos;s a social aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness like you &apos;re a stran@@ ger in a foreign land .
one person sent me a very deta@@ iled descri@@ ption ; the other person didn &apos;t .
and in that pair , one person gets a message saying , &quot; do you want to give up some of your $ 10 you ear@@ ned for being here and ship it to someone else in the lab ? &quot;
you could ro@@ b 200 people on a train , a great innovation .
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
if human beings disappe@@ ared , life on earth as we know it would fl@@ our@@ ish . &quot;
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas z@@ im@@ bab@@ we sky@@ rock@@ et@@ ed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequ@@ ency .
but if you &apos;re like me , my humanity is more like a window .
they never touch the inner matter . there is more and more co-@@ evolution .
not just with the traditional foot , but also the leg , and even of the body .
why ? because i have to consider that and i have to modi@@ fy what i &apos;m saying to say , &quot; it will rain , &quot; or &quot; it &apos;s going to rain . &quot;
but he doesn &apos;t do mira@@ cles just to show off .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
so we still have quite a lot of work to do in terms of un@@ know@@ ns .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the system has moved in a more liber@@ al direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
i loved when he was talking about this other world that &apos;s right next to this world .
we have millions of genes of micro@@ bes in our human micro@@ bi@@ ome co@@ vering us .
and while it &apos;s true that u@@ bun@@ tu is an african idea , what i see is the essen@@ ce of that value being invented here .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an itali@@ an pain@@ ter recogni@@ zed the la@@ p as a gre@@ cian temp@@ le , u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster@@ ed in fl@@ es@@ h and cl@@ oth .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long di@@ stances .
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes .
he could see what was happening to his forest , to his environment , because he was taken under his grand@@ father &apos;s wing when he was only two years old to begin to learn about the forest and the way of life of his people .
mom , does the man just say , &apos; is now the time to take off my pants ? &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates .
so i decided to talk to women about their vag@@ in@@ as .
one is another american inv@@ ent@@ or ted h@@ enter .
on the right hand side , that bit there is part of an instal@@ lation that is about 12 feet long .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
and let &apos;s face it , any new retro@@ virus in the human population -- it &apos;s something we should be aware of .
and i watched them being lo@@ cked up in prison and te@@ ar gas@@ sed .
i &apos;ll try where it all started in the middle east , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the middle east .
when they opened this one up , they found its sto@@ mach was full of plastic .
even though they were im@@ pris@@ oned in this garden of e@@ den with fi@@ gs and everything else .
the battery is not the gas t@@ ank , in a sense .
there are species that have no aging -- hy@@ dr@@ a for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tis@@ su@@ es in fact that rely for their function on very long-@@ lived cells .
i mean , can you imagine ? e@@ .@@ t@@ . &apos; s ph@@ oning home , and i &apos;m not , like , there ? you know , horri@@ ble !
you can see , for example , that the achie@@ vement sc@@ ore almost dou@@ bles in this particular experiment .
there are two things that can really acceler@@ ate this whole process .
my friends , no way they can be that cool and have good of a life .
they squ@@ ir@@ t them at each other , which is lo@@ vely and inno@@ cent .
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian .
this is a bil@@ l@@ board that says : &quot; wel@@ come to the birth@@ place of general t@@ so . &quot;
frank@@ ly , four billion clean cars on the road are still four billion cars , and a traffic ja@@ m with no emissions is still a traffic ja@@ m .
well , inspired by the sent@@ ences , i decided to wi@@ el@@ d the pain@@ t@@ br@@ ush .
i was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
you should get points for doing this on time .
this is an invi@@ tation to the 70 percent of our un@@ ma@@ pped planet .
well , let &apos;s first of all simpli@@ fy the v@@ ases illusion , make the thing on the right .
and he ended up achie@@ ving at a level that had never before been con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ated by any member of his family .
it &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children .
and because working in a store was so hard , i liked going to school ; it was like hea@@ ven .
all right , let &apos;s talk about another perspective on the importance of the oceans .
and he actually took one look at my squ@@ ig@@ g@@ ly line , and said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you just embra@@ ce the sha@@ ke ? &quot;
i went to west virg@@ ini@@ a , the most un@@ healthy state in america .
so when i was born , i guess you could say expec@@ tations were kind of high for me .
and what he did in response , is he went on reg@@ is and kel@@ ly , and broke his old record .
this is a tri@@ -@@ star , and so they let nat@@ as@@ ha actually sit in the jump seat .
everything was okay , until i got to about the age of 26 , and i went to a movie called &quot; short circu@@ it . &quot;
but it is changing the equ@@ ation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decisi@@ on-@@ making .
so this little slide here shows you an op@@ tom@@ e@@ tr@@ ist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ra@@ ti@@ o in the u.@@ k .
and these types of technologies , i see , have the potential to transform the face of hunger and nutri@@ tion , mal@@ nutri@@ tion out on the front lines .
but he fa@@ ked it too well , and now he &apos;s stuck in broad@@ mo@@ or and nobody will believe he &apos;s san@@ e .
we can use some smart it to en@@ h@@ ance trans@@ it and en@@ able car sharing and ride sharing .
down here i noticed this . is this something of y@@ ours , sir ?
at bi@@ om@@ i@@ mi@@ c@@ ry gu@@ il@@ d , which is my consu@@ l@@ ting company , we work with ho@@ k architec@@ ts .
it certainly didn &apos;t pre@@ p@@ are me for what came next .
you can imagine how people get happy with me watching these kinds of scen@@ es .
had he shown his father , &quot; my boy has finally lost it , &quot; he would &apos;ve thought .
but will this only be available for the super rich , for those that can afford it ? are we head@@ ed for a new eu@@ gen@@ ics ?
and what happened was , because they could afford it sometimes , sometimes not , i got ki@@ cked out pretty much every term .
i study ants , and that &apos;s because i like to think about how organizations work .
but , in fact , most boys tend to be a certain way , and most girls tend to be a certain way .
and i say this as a man who has e@@ aten a fair share of cor@@ ned bee@@ f in his life .
now , speaking of walls , i want to share with you the story of one wall in ca@@ ir@@ o .
my son , he says he is not ready to get married .
you can see on the microscop@@ e slide here , that &apos;s what &apos;s happening in real time .
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; i &apos;m no longer a vic@@ tim .
what howard did is he fundament@@ ally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
i want to start off by saying , hou@@ ston , we have a problem .
they are sc@@ ar@@ ce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power gener@@ ating sta@@ tions .
but he was cre@@ di@@ ted with co@@ ining the phr@@ ase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot;
we could do cir@@ cular narra@@ tives that were literally cir@@ cular .
a lot has been said here about women , i don &apos;t need to repe@@ at it .
let &apos;s go back to mi@@ d-@@ 18@@ 0@@ 0s when the chinese first came to america .
he &apos;s an austr@@ ali@@ an ab@@ original el@@ der , and he &apos;s also an artist .
whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope .
i want to say a word for nature because we haven &apos;t talked that much about it the last couple days .
for some of the subje@@ cts , sitting in the far corner of a room is a box of go@@ di@@ va cho@@ col@@ ates , and for others is a can of sp@@ am .
i &apos;d go to the super@@ market and all of my food is pac@@ ka@@ ged in plastic .
so can@@ ny out@@ laws are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine any can@@ ny out@@ law susta@@ ining that for an in@@ defini@@ te period of time .
it &apos;s a com@@ po@@ und cur@@ ve inter@@ ior .
let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosau@@ r@@ -@@ kil@@ ler for 65 million years . they &apos;re very rare .
we need to act like the future depen@@ ds on it .
i think there is a soci@@ ali@@ zing dimension in , kind of , moving that bor@@ der .
so we are moving to this democra@@ ti@@ zation of information , and i &apos;ve been in this field for quite a while .
and literally with only those two in@@ puts -- so , the shape of your boundar@@ y condition and the pressure -- you can define an infin@@ ite number of len@@ ses that cover the range of human re@@ fra@@ ctive er@@ ror , from min@@ us 12 to plus eight di@@ op@@ ters , up to four di@@ op@@ ters of cy@@ lin@@ der .
and they decided in 199@@ 0 that they wanted to start training the local entreprene@@ urs , giving them small lo@@ ans .
well , from the coal bur@@ ned at the power plant through all these com@@ po@@ unding los@@ ses , only a tent@@ h of the fuel energy actually ends up coming out the pi@@ pe as flow .
again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analog@@ y with language .
the deeper you go , the more you run into a conflict with water .
the first one that we see occur@@ s in the ancient rain@@ fore@@ sts of australia about 25 million years ago , and the national geographic society is helping us to explore these fossil de@@ pos@@ its . this is ri@@ ver@@ s@@ lei@@ gh .
that &apos;s when we separate from the back sh@@ ell , and we &apos;re now in fre@@ e-@@ fall .
it &apos;s kind of ne@@ at . what a wonderful design .
one of your students must have been pas@@ sing by , showed them how to use the mouse . &quot;
we pu@@ mp the flu@@ id through one of these systems , and we press the butt@@ on , and it &apos;s analy@@ zed for the genom@@ ic character .
h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls new data visu@@ als that un@@ tan@@ gle the complex risk fac@@ tors of one of the world &apos;s de@@ ad@@ li@@ est diseases : hiv . he argu@@ es that pre@@ vent@@ ing trans@@ mis@@ sions -- not drug treat@@ ments -- is the key to en@@ ding the epidemic .
well it turns out that yes , the different tas@@ ks are inter@@ depen@@ dent .
the ideas are coming back from the consum@@ ers , and they &apos;re often ahead of the produ@@ cers .
he was a very good gol@@ fer , but he had a dis@@ ability .
and if you look at the top left , you see a little teen@@ y dark do@@ t .
so we have the finger bla@@ sters . other people have dinosaurs , you know .
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one machin@@ ed for myself .
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it .
so mot@@ ts is doing something here , and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activ@@ ated on the motor cortex .
sort of like the spin@@ al ta@@ p scene where you get the tiny little st@@ one@@ hen@@ ge , i guess ?
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of sc@@ aling up .
no , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; it would destro@@ y me . &quot;
and they took one look and ran out the back to draw short stra@@ ws .
and i feel that way because three billion people in the world today , over the next 20 years , will need a new home .
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot;
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
na@@ ma@@ ste . sal@@ a@@ am .
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem .
heart and blood ves@@ sel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combin@@ ed , and yet it &apos;s completely pre@@ vent@@ able for almost everybody .
there was a great ted moment , i think it was sir ken ro@@ bin@@ son , was it ?
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of can@@ v@@ ases .
the philosop@@ her mar@@ th@@ a n@@ uss@@ baum points this out in this quote : &quot; th@@ us throughout history , certain dis@@ g@@ ust properties -- sli@@ min@@ ess , bad smell , sti@@ ck@@ iness , deca@@ y , f@@ ou@@ l@@ ness -- have been repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly and mon@@ ot@@ on@@ ously been associated with ...
when people come to an un@@ familiar situation they don &apos;t know how to deal with they slow down .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
now i &apos;m going to show you how business as usual will affect this .
so there &apos;s a lot more female gam@@ ers than people are really aware .
and then they benefit through the ex@@ pos@@ ure , adverti@@ sing and lin@@ ked sal@@ es .
running through this typical letter that they had , i ran it through my simpli@@ city lab , it &apos;s pretty un@@ intelli@@ gi@@ ble .
my father and my grand@@ father were always looking for the ne@@ west thing in alternative or traditional therap@@ ies for ph , but after six months , i couldn &apos;t walk up a small h@@ ill . i couldn &apos;t clim@@ b a flight of sta@@ irs .
so it &apos;s actually a multi-@@ dimensional user interface .
one of the things i do a lot is publi@@ c@@ -@@ private partner@@ ships .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
let &apos;s create a word process@@ or that &apos;s just a word process@@ or .
we have even managed to make the study of liter@@ ature ar@@ can@@ e .
now , there are around a thousand tru@@ cks and bus@@ es and cars there .
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms .
in fact we do not want this poor woman to work the land like this .
and the hop@@ e@@ ful response der@@ i@@ ves from recogni@@ zing that islam and democracy are technologies .
it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level .
so babies absor@@ b the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the cul@@ tu@@ re-@@ bo@@ und listen@@ ers that we are .
so they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better .
really , consciousness is se@@ ated in the fron@@ tal lo@@ be .
it does hurt . and we rein@@ force the story@@ line , right ?
so argu@@ ing against , a man who &apos;s been at the ni@@ tty , gri@@ tty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
and that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states .
exactly . because i &apos;m not even tou@@ ching it .
no , because the wind should get in trouble .
and if we can switch to sli@@ des -- all right , here we go .
i think it &apos;s important to pro@@ mote in a more positive way on how we see ourselves .
you could say , well , it doesn &apos;t look very different from when he started .
and there is no way , and no pro@@ of of arri@@ val .
and , like ch@@ ie@@ f se@@ attle said , &quot; we did not sp@@ in the web of life .
power of shape : here &apos;s a wh@@ ale . we &apos;ve seen that the fin@@ s of this wh@@ ale have tu@@ ber@@ cles on them . and those little bu@@ mp@@ s actually increase efficiency in , for instance , the edge of an airplane -- increase efficiency by about 32 percent .
the first problem is there &apos;s in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate disaster response .
there &apos;s never been an angel@@ - or a vent@@ u@@ re-@@ fund@@ ed company where bad things didn &apos;t happen .
and now along with that , along with the experience of starting an enter@@ prise , or running something -- and it doesn &apos;t have to be a business .
that was it . that &apos;s all he saw as the op@@ tions . and not too far off .
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space .
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about t@@ ms .
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away .
well what they found was mis@@ lab@@ el@@ ed fish .
obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
so today i want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
they &apos;re ex@@ o@@ tic . they &apos;re experiment@@ al .
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
we discovered they work by inter@@ molecular forces alone .
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding ste@@ ad@@ y .
we need it for our everyday life , in order to make the world a smaller place .
or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; actually . &quot;
and so , i want to kind of go through my little story of what i found out .
i &apos;m going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history of compassion and the golden rule .
we &apos;re going to hear from two people who are on the shar@@ p end of the law .
the way we tend to use resources is we extra@@ ct them , we turn them into shor@@ t-@@ life products and then dis@@ pose of them .
the point being , this is going to be very , very inten@@ sive on the progra@@ mming side .
we can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and i cla@@ im that the engineering approach is within range .
she said &quot; yes , that &apos;s former vice president al gore and his wife ti@@ pp@@ er . &quot;
it makes failure invisible , in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and inevi@@ table .
but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bow@@ l to air that ad , even though , at the time , they only had a million dollars in an@@ nu@@ al re@@ venue .
it &apos;s a video that was done by one of the companies that i ment@@ or .
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to over@@ come .
they are f@@ used together , so you can &apos;t separate them .
i got acc@@ used in a few blogs that i was actually sent by the po@@ pe to pre@@ ach the trin@@ ity and ca@@ tho@@ lic@@ ism in the middle east , so you -- you believe who you want . i gave you my version of the story .
so , this device here is an invisi@@ bility clo@@ ak .
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down sta@@ irs .
do you have a wal@@ let on you ? joe : i don &apos;t .
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
we &apos;ve talked about mo@@ bility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health .
we need that same kind of passion and energy to attack global gri@@ d@@ lock .
i put the question -- three or four weeks ago , we saw in the new@@ spa@@ pers millions of fish that die in nor@@ way .
we need to look for something else , and we &apos;ve gotten ourselves a little bit into a ru@@ t .
it didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge .
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money .
for some reason , i thought it would be a good idea to put an inter@@ mission in my talk .
now , the opposite of a s@@ no@@ b is your mother .
i put rever@@ se thr@@ ust and i try and pull g@@ ently down .
i &apos;m s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing this other dog &apos;s re@@ ar end , the ow@@ ner &apos;s calling . &quot;
and there &apos;s tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven &apos;t been ma@@ pped yet .
and it was his universe on pun@@ ch cards .
so we up@@ d@@ ated them , so i could present it here , to 2007 .
so we asked lar@@ ry and nat@@ al@@ ie he@@ m@@ pel to write a comm@@ ent@@ ary situ@@ ating the fin@@ dings for scientists , right , putting in the refer@@ ences , and we sub@@ mit it to biology letters .
and i stood there bes@@ i@@ de two very good friends of mine , richard we@@ ber and kev@@ in v@@ all@@ ely .
so it &apos;s been a very optimi@@ stic time , i think , and i want to just talk about a few of those things .
and we re-@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that dete@@ ctor -- im@@ men@@ se numbers .
if you don &apos;t have open spaces , you &apos;ve got to go there and open spaces .
i mean , i cut through three years of engineering meetings , design and system integra@@ tion , and introduced dep@@ th@@ x -- deep ph@@ re@@ a@@ tic ther@@ mal explor@@ er .
the next day i came to see him . i was like , &quot; doctor , that was a really good jo@@ ke . &quot;
at 7 p@@ .@@ m@@ . on a sun@@ day in hidden spr@@ ings , i@@ da@@ h@@ o , where the six members of the star@@ r family are sitting down to the high@@ light of their week : the family meeting .
and i -- no one else did , so i put up my hand , and i said , &quot; it &apos;s a bac@@ chan@@ al by ti@@ ti@@ an . &quot;
but on the other hand , it was the scientific gold of the project , because we could really cr@@ ank this baby up , as a scientific tool , and see if we could , in fact , find where those seven tons of oxygen had gone .
these are the basic fe@@ atures of my device , or our device .
so the team developed new de@@ bu@@ g@@ ging software , where we could test each syn@@ thetic frag@@ ment to see if it would grow in a background of wild type dna .
and i can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
in that ho@@ spi@@ ce , there were 3@@ 1 men and women who were ac@@ tively dying .
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of ble@@ ed between speech and writing .
to me it is something from the@@ at@@ re , and i will get back to that a little bit later .
there are three obvious ways of doing this .
&quot; you can call it a dinosau@@ r , but look at the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor : the vel@@ o@@ ci@@ ra@@ p@@ tor is cool . &quot;
and at first , it &apos;s just a blu@@ r , but very quickly distin@@ ct things begin to appear in that blu@@ r .
so people were looking at these and they were talking about how different they are .
and you can notice they have created a kind of fal@@ se cat@@ ch@@ ment .
if i choose a different way of moving -- on the right for example -- then i &apos;ll have a different comm@@ and , different noise , playing through a no@@ is@@ y system , very complicated .
we &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . ok .
expres@@ sed in the relevant unit , it is spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly small .
we found that the indu@@ s scri@@ pt actually falls within the range of the l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic scri@@ p@@ ts .
all right .
&#91; &quot; acade@@ my a@@ ward w@@ inner for visual effects &quot; &#93; second doctor : wel@@ come to your new body , ja@@ ke@@ .@@ first doctor : good .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chem@@ ist turned budd@@ h@@ ist mon@@ k mat@@ th@@ ie@@ u ri@@ card says we can train our minds in hab@@ its of well-@@ being , to generate a true sense of ser@@ en@@ ity and ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
there &apos;s a je@@ wish saying that i love .
but that &apos;s the only -- no , we were only photograph@@ ed twice .
as we star@@ ed sc@@ aling it up we looked at what is the problem to come up to the u.s. ?
first , it would be to understand that it could be considered a co@@ oper@@ ative , and this is a thought from the brazi@@ li@@ an legal sch@@ ol@@ ar ro@@ ber@@ to man@@ gab@@ ei@@ ra unger .
so pretty much players are encoura@@ ged to be very creative in the game .
and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occu@@ p@@ y .
but we feel like this could work in other places .
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years .
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong .
and the dra@@ gon@@ flies are there . i have repor@@ ts from my various cont@@ acts .
that means we get our new hi@@ ps for free .
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon .
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from .
at the same time , i was thinking , well , there &apos;s lots of possibility here to produce con@@ temporary products , away from the eth@@ ni@@ c , a little bit more con@@ temporary .
and that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
so we can study this as a physical , intui@@ tive model .
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second .
we are progra@@ mm@@ ed for something called pro@@ creative success .
on the computer , when you move your mouse , that ar@@ row moves around .
today we &apos;re moving to a multi@@ pol@@ ar world in which co@@ ordin@@ ation is much more complicated , as we have seen at cop@@ en@@ ha@@ gen .
in addition to that , after the baby &apos;s born , our other unique invention as ma@@ mm@@ als is that we n@@ our@@ ish our off@@ spring after they &apos;re born .
he had a di@@ xi@@ eland ja@@ zz band when we were growing up , and he would always cover lou@@ is arm@@ strong tun@@ es .
they do a dna scan of this , they will come up with a great ma@@ il@@ ing list .
aid cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m fir@@ m@@ ly convinced about that .
zir@@ con@@ s that are min@@ ed in the jack h@@ ills of western australia , zir@@ con@@ s taken from the jack h@@ ills of western australia tell us that within a few hundred million years of the orig@@ in of the planet there was ab@@ und@@ ant water and perhaps even life .
and the interesting thing is that if you change the sequence , you change the three-@@ dimensional fol@@ ding .
nature &apos;s main process of creation , mor@@ pho@@ gen@@ es@@ is , is the spli@@ tting of one cell into two cells .
and he said , &quot; because no one knows you had anything to do with it . &quot;
it was a table as long as this car@@ pet and the h@@ arb@@ or com@@ mis@@ sion@@ er was here , and i was here , and my guys .
but i rec@@ ited a che@@ er . i rec@@ ited a che@@ er along with everybody else .
could we le@@ verage these technologies to switch smar@@ tly whenever you travel from country to country ?
and they &apos;re invest@@ ing in tele@@ com@@ s , sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ alls .
and basically , since we rele@@ ased it about three or four years ago , a lot of web@@ sites have started swi@@ t@@ ching from the old cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a where people wa@@ sted their time to the new cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a where people are helping to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
but remember , gre@@ e@@ ce is there today .
one day a nasa man@@ ager comes into my office , si@@ ts down and says , &quot; can you please tell us , how do we look for life outside earth ? &quot;
when you pu@@ mp in air in a bi@@ cycle , you use a bit of this .
i have things to do , people to im@@ press , and places to go . &quot;
what happens when a city deci@@ des it &apos;s going to set other pri@@ ori@@ ties ?
i can see i &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encoura@@ ge you to do the same .
it &apos;s cru@@ cial to understand , i believe , because of technology and because of glob@@ alization , societies from bot@@ tom@@ -up .
it &apos;s this brain which makes this refle@@ x .
when asked , they said , &quot; it &apos;s kind of like a giant toi@@ let that doesn &apos;t fl@@ ush . &quot;
i also need al@@ co@@ hol and mor@@ ph@@ ine , because it &apos;s the only way i can work . &quot;
and what &apos;s interesting is that it was just 199@@ 0 when it was more than two dollars a minute .
we know our societies have to radi@@ cally change .
it didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace .
imagine making all of our hard materials that way .
it was ridi@@ cul@@ ous . i couldn &apos;t get a mobile phone plan because my credit history didn &apos;t travel with me .
well , just imagine a world , for the moment , divi@@ ded into two cam@@ ps .
and i set up kan@@ ch@@ i , because my organization was always going to be named after my eleph@@ ant , because dis@@ ability is like the eleph@@ ant in the room .
anyway , please join me in teaching these values .
there &apos;s all these different interven@@ tions but they have different kinds of effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
and where they have a problem with this kind of mes@@ h , because they don &apos;t have sp@@ ines .
when i was po@@ et lau@@ re@@ ate , there i go again -- i can &apos;t help it , it &apos;s true -- i created a poetry chan@@ nel on del@@ ta air@@ lines that la@@ sted for a couple of years .
so let me end with just a few words about appli@@ cations that we &apos;ve found for this .
talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
your head now is 100 y@@ ards away , sa@@ il@@ ing through the air , ok ?
well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system .
i ski@@ pped school often and dre@@ am@@ ed of becoming a sa@@ il@@ or during those days .
i would like to encoura@@ ge you to open your mind .
right , the current wants to run through the pla@@ y-@@ d@@ ough , not through that led .
but i wanted to try and en@@ rich him .
and so to me the question is not whether these dynam@@ ics will continue the way they have .
and they were probably pleas@@ ed to see you on top of the time po@@ ll .
why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being inter@@ rup@@ ted all day at the office ?
or , more importantly , hiv , where the virus evol@@ ves so quickly the vac@@ cin@@ es that are made today can &apos;t keep up with those evolutionary changes .
cham@@ pi@@ on sounds so goo@@ fy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ?
there are tens of thousands of those stories out there , and it &apos;s really hard to con@@ j@@ ure up much of a sense of well-@@ being , because it just kee@@ ps getting worse .
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died .
imagine our hig@@ hl@@ y-@@ tun@@ ed , ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time food industry and our hig@@ hl@@ y-@@ st@@ ressed agri@@ cultural system fail@@ ing and super@@ market shel@@ ves emp@@ t@@ ying .
i &apos;m gla@@ d you heard earlier today , bat@@ ter@@ ies are un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably energy -- lack of den@@ sity compared to fuel .
in india , we had the na@@ x@@ ali@@ te movement , the &#91; un@@ clear &#93; movement .
i &apos;m a marke@@ ter , and as a marke@@ ter , i know that i &apos;ve never really been in control .
it &apos;s simply the propor@@ tion of the population who agree most people can be tru@@ sted .
and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually conne@@ cting to all these people .
and that was that she did two entire shows pro@@ mot@@ ing that movie &quot; the secret . &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s one of the biggest problems with che@@ mo@@ therapy today .
and this is the space probe cas@@ sin@@ i pir@@ ou@@ et@@ ting through the ice r@@ ings of saturn .
so , the new festi@@ val , it as@@ ks the audience to play an essential role in sha@@ ping the performance .
and , with that , comes the third point , which is ob@@ li@@ gation -- and an ob@@ li@@ gation to that avail@@ ability .
and the size of the dots is going to be propor@@ tional to how many of their friends have the flu .
you see the red glo@@ w in their eyes , which is the refle@@ ction of the flas@@ h@@ light .
give him to the army . we &apos;ll never see him again . we &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
and we placed him in a company in western kenya , just 200 miles away .
well , consider by analog@@ y , the concept of physical health .
i guess you can only have one mira@@ cle per building .
you &apos;re a good person . you com@@ pla@@ in .
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school .
this is a view taken along the sum@@ mit ri@@ dge .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
and that they were definitely capable of diff@@ using it non-@@ ag@@ gressi@@ vely .
micro@@ fin@@ ance is an incredibly powerful tool that leads to self-@@ suff@@ i@@ ci@@ ency and self-@@ respect , but we must move beyond micro@@ -@@ hop@@ es and micro@@ -@@ ambi@@ tions for women , because they have so much greater hop@@ es for themselves .
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist .
so as we talked , richard and i , i said , &quot; you know , maybe i should bring a cam@@ el .
he &apos;s thinking -- of course it &apos;s all a concept -- of inje@@ cting ty@@ pe@@ faces into sper@@ ma@@ to@@ zo@@ a , i don &apos;t know how to say it in english -- sper@@ ma@@ ta@@ zo@@ i -- in order to make them become -- to almost have a song or a whole po@@ em written with every e@@ jac@@ u@@ lation .
but there are these , what we call , positive feed@@ bac@@ ks , the sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ es among them that make the whole va@@ stly greater than the sum of the parts .
so , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
i would be a jer@@ k and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &apos;s central african re@@ public .
i &apos;ve done a lot of speaking in germany and in fr@@ ance , and in different parts of the world -- 10@@ 5 countries it &apos;s been my privi@@ lege to speak in .
but the problem isn &apos;t pri@@ mar@@ ily that we &apos;re elec@@ ting bad people to con@@ gress .
so if religion is not about belie@@ ving things , what is it about ?
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly like a bird .
l@@ p : i &apos;d just like to end off by just saying this : it took me four months again to feel my hands .
one of the key areas we &apos;ve been working on recently is medical devices , and while it may not be obvious that medical devices have something in common with iraq &apos;s electricity grid then , there are some common@@ ali@@ ties .
so , imagine that all of you are partici@@ pants in the study .
so , that &apos;s a scen@@ ari@@ o that we think we should be capit@@ ali@@ zing on .
and the way i sold li@@ ve@@ stock jobs is i showed off my dra@@ wings , i showed off pictures of things .
so eight of us went in : four men and four women .
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well .
and colle@@ c@@ tively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
there isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural cre@@ ature .
during 4@@ 1 years of teaching biology at harvard , i watched sa@@ dly as bright students turned away from the possibility of a scientific career or even from taking non-@@ requi@@ red cour@@ ses in science because they were afraid of failure .
so this was a trick to get these two sides .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of per@@ cents in order to del@@ ay gra@@ ti@@ fication and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
you can qu@@ it i@@ .@@ m@@ . ; you can &apos;t hi@@ de your man@@ ager .
and i wa@@ ited , and the next day i liked it a bit better , the next day i liked it a bit better , and now i really love it .
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then .
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money .
here &apos;s a design for dist@@ ill@@ ing water using sun@@ light .
in fact , you can see each lo@@ go is a little bit different .
as fast as we can res@@ et our computers , the brain activity shif@@ ts to start repres@@ enting this new tool , as if this too was a part of that pri@@ mate &apos;s body .
and you see , everybody &apos;s bus@@ y . there was no time to waste .
so , here , whatever movement i do in my physical world is actually repli@@ cated inside the digital world just using this small device that i made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illu@@ strate .
and we stit@@ ch them together like medi@@ ev@@ al mon@@ ks .
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea .
and you get to think about yourself and your memor@@ ies , and before you go back into sus@@ pen@@ sion , you ed@@ it your memor@@ ies and you change your person@@ ality and so forth .
what about ath@@ ens ? medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an climate , but in the sun it was not comfortable . they didn &apos;t percei@@ ve comfort .
of course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because climate change has good pictures .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
some of the studies even say we &apos;re happ@@ ier .
so this is the gul@@ f of mexico , spar@@ kl@@ ing place full of fish .
so i pac@@ ked my c@@ at , my ro@@ tt@@ wei@@ ler and my cam@@ ping ge@@ ar into a 197@@ 5 ch@@ ev@@ y van , and dro@@ ve off into the sun@@ set , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
so the idea was , okay , keep that feeling of freedom , but change the v@@ ec@@ tor and increase the time .
so this is our last number , and we &apos;ll fe@@ ature n@@ at on piano .
he depen@@ ds , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful .
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life .
fashion designer is@@ a@@ a@@ c mi@@ z@@ ra@@ hi sp@@ ins through a di@@ zz@@ ying ar@@ ray of inspi@@ ra@@ tions -- from &apos; 5@@ 0s pin@@ u@@ ps to a fle@@ eting gli@@ mp@@ se of a woman on the street who makes him sh@@ out &quot; stop the ca@@ b ! &quot; inside this ra@@ m@@ bling talk are real clu@@ es to living a happy , creative life .
they &apos;re in@@ expensive , really ru@@ g@@ ged .
in effect , the cancer cell was for@@ getting it was cancer and becoming a normal cell .
so the possibility exists to simply ex@@ tern@@ ally wra@@ p the pi@@ pe .
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that .
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot;
as we go smaller , here is a human hair .
what &apos;s also happening in shang@@ hai is -- china is changing because this wouldn &apos;t have happened five years ago , for instance . this is a hol@@ d@@ out .
and this is true , as you can see , for all countries , including the so-@@ called developing countries .
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwi@@ ch .
i don &apos;t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
and instead of inst@@ all@@ ing the lar@@ ge-@@ scale machines used by western produ@@ cers , they used low-@@ cost c@@ ad / c@@ am prototyp@@ ing technology .
but what happened was , the rules changed , and they never got to make partner .
we need to learn how to re@@ pair and re@@ pl@@ en@@ ish the earth &apos;s o@@ zone layer .
now , i &apos;m sure most of you have seen the movie &quot; far@@ go . &quot;
nat@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant s@@ ings from her new al@@ bu@@ m , &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; leave your sleep . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; ly@@ ri@@ cs from ne@@ ar-@@ for@@ gotten 19@@ th-@@ century poetry pair with her un@@ mista@@ k@@ able voice for a performance that brought the audience to its feet .
and many designers have been working recently on the idea of death and m@@ our@@ ning , and what we can do about it today with new technologies .
we &apos;re interested in big dis@@ plays , bright dis@@ plays .
but the teachers came to me after@@ ward and told me they hadn &apos;t seen the kids that atten@@ tive .
here &apos;s one of my fellow w@@ inn@@ ers . that &apos;s charles pa@@ x@@ ton who won the 2000 biology prize for his paper , &quot; cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p behavior of o@@ stri@@ ches towards humans under far@@ ming conditions in britain . &quot;
and at heart , both re@@ forma@@ tions , i think were asking the questions : who &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to practice ?
would you like to close down the trial now , or should we wait until we have rob@@ ust results ? &quot;
despite the fact that each and every one of these dis@@ orders origin@@ ates in the brain , most of these dis@@ orders are diagno@@ sed sol@@ ely on the basis of obser@@ vable behavior .
but what they were very good at doing was making it very lo@@ c@@ alized .
so , today who is it going to take to spread the infe@@ ction from 100,000 children to the 200 million children in india ?
this is the basis for the device that these two guys at ford built .
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
and once you &apos;ve trained up the dete@@ ctions , these thoughts can be as@@ sig@@ ned or ma@@ pped to any computing platform , app@@ lic@@ ation or device .
and i would see the ex@@ as@@ per@@ ation between my american and european colleagues , when they were dealing with india .
and so even if we make those very important decisions for very sil@@ ly reasons , it rema@@ ins statisti@@ cally true that there are more geor@@ ges living in geor@@ gi@@ a and there are more den@@ nis@@ es becoming den@@ ti@@ sts and there are more pau@@ las who are married to paul than statisti@@ cally vi@@ able .
they are 7@@ ,000 every year -- people coming for the first time .
he talked mostly about animals and plants , but also about languages evol@@ ving and becoming extin@@ ct .
when he a@@ im@@ ed , he never mis@@ sed .
we need an anti-@@ temp@@ le@@ ton to step forward .
it &apos;s not that it guar@@ an@@ te@@ es peace with itself or with its neighb@@ ors .
bi@@ om@@ i@@ mi@@ c@@ ry , which is something that is an emerging science , win@@ ds up being a very important social justice idea .
had colle@@ cted photographs of me , as mothers will do .
and i tried to -- there &apos;s a ni@@ ck gri@@ m@@ sha@@ w building over here , there &apos;s an ol@@ den@@ bur@@ g sculp@@ ture over here -- i tried to make a relationship ur@@ b@@ ani@@ sti@@ cally .
what zi@@ p@@ car does is we park cars throughout den@@ se urban areas for members to reser@@ ve , by the hour and by the day , instead of using their own car .
learning about the natural world is one thing ; learning from the natural world -- that &apos;s the switch .
and , i mean , everybody in this room -- now , this is 3@@ 50 short years ago .
so let me show you , and i &apos;m going to start with the standard method first .
and you can see that it kind of ho@@ ck@@ ey sti@@ cks up around the 196@@ 0s and &apos; 7@@ 0s , and it &apos;s on kind of a nice tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory right now .
and then this back down on the ground and you can see that the fun@@ gu@@ s is actually inv@@ ading this tree .
they &apos;re the largest of the tun@@ as , the secon@@ d-@@ largest fish in the sea -- bon@@ y fish .
rather enjo@@ ying what the sol@@ o@@ ist is doing .
and if you can do that , incredible things happen .
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the plan@@ ks .
it ta@@ stes great within the bor@@ ders of that country , but absolute shi@@ te if you take it anywhere else .
and it &apos;s one that off@@ ers really interesting possibilities for organi@@ zing a whole ho@@ st of activi@@ ties down the road .
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field .
the engineers fle@@ w over , and designers got together with them , and they put their pres@@ entation together .
to be more accu@@ rate , i wanted to be a pop star .
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &apos;t do anything funny .
and this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio v@@ acc@@ ine that tar@@ ge@@ ted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
co@@ lin c@@ amer@@ er : neuro@@ science , game theory , mon@@ keys
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that .
and she took us on a journey and reve@@ aled something very special to us -- her own daughter , eight days old .
so , if you believe the media accoun@@ ts , being a drug de@@ aler in the hei@@ ght of the cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine epidemic was a very glam@@ or@@ ous life , in the words of virg@@ ini@@ a po@@ stre@@ l .
now let me take you for a moment to what &apos;s wid@@ ely re@@ gar@@ ded as the world &apos;s most difficult conflict , or the most impossible conflict , is the middle east .
and we thought we were going to be able to lay these deb@@ ts off on our kids , but , guess what ?
over time , those gas molecules dis@@ solve into your blood and tis@@ su@@ es and start to fill you up .
inv@@ ent@@ or , entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r and visi@@ on@@ ary ray kurz@@ weil explains in ab@@ und@@ ant , gro@@ unded detail why , by the 20@@ 20@@ s , we will have rever@@ se-@@ engine@@ ered the human brain and nan@@ ob@@ ots will be operating your consciousness .
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island .
and we will live in a very pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful world . thank you very much .
and all of it was coming from this : sh@@ ri@@ mp far@@ ms .
what you see in this top drawing is a sche@@ matic of how pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um gets used in the u.s. economy .
so dealing with it is just an immedi@@ ate master plan .
you must stop . stop .
no dou@@ bt that it &apos;s going to happen , in my mind .
now this rather old photo up there is actually the first project i was ever hi@@ red to do , something like 25 years ago .
this is the great lea@@ p forward , when china fell down .
