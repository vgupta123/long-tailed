thank you . 
wonderful motor . 
data is relationships . 
thank you . thank you . 
kt : no . 
it was terrible . 
idea about women . 
the bride . 
there were hollywood . 
very difficult . 
good afternoon . 
thank you . 
this is what goes . 
tedx . 
don &apos;t make sense . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
all right . 
529 . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
no thing . 
my technology . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
good afternoon . 
it &apos;s dying . 
it &apos;s really . 
all right ? good . 
here we go . 
they never have that . 
oh , wonderful . 
and then , finally ... 
no further proof . 
think of war . 
thank you , thank you . 
i don &apos;t think so . 
this was 2007 . 
it was incredible . 
goodbye . 
so thank you . 
what &apos;s done . 
all right , further . 
so , okay ! 
there it is . 
you &apos;re happy . 
an amazing woman . 
the opposite happened . 
i was seven . 
don &apos;t ask . 
this was incredible . 
here are some numbers . 
without sex . 
one in 100 . 
it was fantastic . 
it &apos;s wrong . 
smart , right ? 
ideas change states . 
three different options . 
this is a city . 
he was obsessed . 
everybody is welcome . 
she was boring . 
here &apos;s another one . 
we have to change everything . 
and that makes sense . 
technology is changing . 
it &apos;s right here . 
you know the story . 
i was very moved . 
one person wins . 
it looks like this . 
it takes basically everything . 
n thank you . 
companies want different things . 
audience : february . 
it &apos;s 1983 . 
everybody showed up . 
they were laughing together . 
so i slowly read . 
so much , right ? 
they finished . 
we had plans . 
terrible , terrible . 
it didn &apos;t work . 
this is very important . 
create space for it . 
it was incredibly successful . 
i was so proud . 
second , economic growth . 
almost everybody sees television . 
ok , six of them . 
you know . 
and uninteresting about that . 
all of this is over . 
and this is what happens here . 
you see it all the time . 
that was amazing . 
this is how edv started . 
that &apos;s the biggest one . 
here we are today . 
but i didn &apos;t find one . 
she goes bicycle . 
easy to bend . 
so i film . 
thank you , scott . 
that &apos;s the end . 
that &apos;s true . 
every school is successful . 
these are big problems . 
we would be very successful . 
girl : holly . 
that &apos;s a lot . 
i was just watching . 
we have to change . 
the answer is no . 
design comes from within . 
thank you . all right . 
scientists say no . 
we gave back something . 
he saw talent differently . 
now everything is possible . 
so i showed him . 
thank you very much . 
we tell ourselves stories . 
so let &apos;s start this . 
we &apos;re late on it . 
the energy is free . 
through the mothermilk . 
this is the breakthrough . 
thank you very much . 
they &apos;re all different . 
it &apos;s really serious . 
and now from 2012 . 
it was all these things . 
they just don &apos;t move . 
i loved getting myself in . 
you knew it . 
yeah , contrast . 
let &apos;s try it again . 
but they were empty . 
wish i could . 
bless you . 
that changed my life . 
anyway , it goes on . 
science is clearly clear . 
not silicon . 
bring it back up again . 
it &apos;s too late . 
everybody knew the answer to that . 
the majority of people . 
but it moved me . 
i brought them along . 
this is the death star . 
and he agreed . 
navigation is difficult . 
it &apos;s a simple answer . 
you know that , right ? 
so big tragedy . 
i took them aside . 
this is two days ago . 
there &apos;s only one problem . 
it wasn &apos;t bad . 
audience : 6th 6 . 
it &apos;s this pyramid . 
glamour and richness . 
and that affected me . 
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot; 
they act compassionately . 
but that &apos;s not all . 
everything else is planned . 
because the world is big . 
but let &apos;s play with it . 
it was like a revolution . 
this is my big wish . 
it &apos;s about this big . 
it &apos;s movement and emotion . 
that was great . 
so here &apos;s the tumor . 
there &apos;s another decision . 
here &apos;s a problem . 
here &apos;s a detail . 
everything open , everything available . 
first , play is universal . 
and we get there . 
it &apos;s 400 years old . 
this is what i want to talk about . 
i &apos;ll get to that later . 
this picture is probably better . 
it doesn &apos;t understand the meaning . 
they were hearing the boys . 
and now she does that . 
it was a good experience . 
the question was , where ? 
let &apos;s say that . 
and he has a mission . 
he fell into the coma . 
so , what do you think ? 
here &apos;s some of them . 
unfortunately , she &apos;s not . 
and it has to be free . 
that &apos;s one thing . 
this system is broken . 
we &apos;re used to that . 
and it &apos;s after two years . 
so i &apos;m going to do it . 
this is the financial crisis . 
they don &apos;t read the music . 
thank you very much . 
every dot is a person . 
even that wasn &apos;t enough . 
and that &apos;s what wikipedia understood . 
you just don &apos;t like it . 
and feel good about it . 
it looks like this . 
that &apos;s great , isn &apos;t it ? 
they were actively active once . 
that led to nothing . 
this is immensely present . 
i know that &apos;s working . 
audience : &quot; rah . &quot; 
i would almost miss it . 
it &apos;s so straightforward . 
and this is the same way i work now . 
and it grew for 600 years . 
status is very important to them . 
we had to work on meat . 
and i &apos;m telling you about that . 
and that &apos;s exactly what it &apos;s about . 
i want to talk about that today . 
and maybe that &apos;s the problem . 
they &apos;re related . 
so you do this . 
that &apos;s -- not true . 
it was a big challenge . 
and this is interesting . 
this is my student tony . 
so we need to get better . 
here &apos;s the year . 
it &apos;s a wonderful thing . 
there are many different forms . 
they were literally plate . 
and unfortunately , it was successful . 
and in 1980 , something happened . 
and this happened over and over again . 
and this is what it looks like . 
it was deployed . 
income is rising too . 
you can all do that . 
so we zoom in . 
i just put that in there . 
so , here &apos;s the picture . 
and that &apos;s exactly what i did . 
the key here is compassion . 
they &apos;re sitting in debris . 
they attacked them . 
you , you can teach it . 
so , what are we doing now ? 
but it &apos;s not that simple . 
and i was a part of it . 
louis kahn , yeah ! 
and not all of it is bad . 
we can cure disease . 
it &apos;s not trivial . 
i &apos;m like , &quot; yeah . 
&quot; the snail . &quot; 
this is my social experience . &quot; 
i believe in real life . 
it &apos;s an example of advertising . 
it sounds like this . 
she became part of me . 
there is the continent of africa . 
it protects the birds . 
absolutely nice to do that . 
they send him to iraq . 
resolutions , smoke . 
this was a crucial mistake . 
they thought this was fundamental . 
and you see that contract . 
you have to stop . end with it . 
and there &apos;s even a church . 
and then they heard the real thing . 
but the use is enormously . 
you have to be miserable . &quot; 
i &apos;m not the best one . 
in architecture , it works the same way . 
so , how do we improve education ? 
and bees are very faithful . 
i &apos;d like to show you . 
&quot; daddy , help . &quot; 
so , back to the session . 
now i know frequency . 
thank you . jy : thank you . 
now , this is very interesting . 
and the woman had sex with it . 
now , this is a talent . 
they don &apos;t need the sun at all . 
it &apos;s extremely sporting . 
you don &apos;t need anything else . &quot; 
this is a very simple example . 
it &apos;s certainly not like china . 
your decisions , your actions count . 
we go to blind dates . 
and that &apos;s not a diet . 
ts : thank you , john . 
she &apos;s in high school . 
yes ? sui : yeah . 
this is the rocket . 
but that was just a beginning . 
and now it falls to soil . 
my ancestors went to the u.s . 
i &apos;ll just let you read it . 
this is the responsibility of the architect . 
the piece is not complicated at all . 
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot; 
governments don &apos;t change that . why ? 
and there will be no mistakes . &quot; 
namaste . salaam . 
second , to make them interactive . 
it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true . 
again , &quot; inward out . &quot; 
for example , it stimulates creativity . 
you all know the story , yes ? 
the programmers come and go . 
yeah , it &apos;s going to go on like this . 
another nectar is found . 
well done , ladies and gentlemen . 
roger , i got her . 
but that &apos;s the basis of innovation . 
and that &apos;s the beauty of emotions . 
ah , mark -- serfaas . 
i accept where we are . 
and that &apos;s the sad part . 
and that &apos;s not broken together . 
this is an engineering task . &quot; 
chromosome one , upper left . 
and there &apos;s a cold atmosphere . 
and nokia , we also have . 
but i do that all the time . 
thank you for coming here . 
and of course , it will become a circle . 
&quot; it &apos;s all good . &quot; 
we need data , no help . 
they can invent and develop . 
it brings me up . honestly . 
that &apos;s what happens in your body . 
is it because i write good ? 
and i think that &apos;s probably right . 
and we knew we were right . 
but yes , there are some solutions . 
and they tried everything they had . 
of course , they got it wrong . 
i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot; 
we looked at the tissue . 
they &apos;re completely anonymous , in a way . 
liberia . and congo . 
in the hospital , it &apos;s normal . 
you see something i mean . 
and so i came through school . 
and we had all this on tape . 
and this is actually my positive . 
let me show you what it looks like . 
they get basic goods like electricity . 
it &apos;s the most important map of all . 
open your hand . thank you . 
come here , next to me . 
i thought that must just pass that . 
and i drew it for them . 
i say , &quot; online organization . &quot; 
but people didn &apos;t understand it . 
and i &apos;ll show you a graph . 
and i met the dozo . 
so let me show you what happens . 
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing about it . 
that &apos;s what i &apos;m asking all the time . 
need is the mother of evolution . 
you know , we need to go through there . 
we rarely look in the sky . 
regret , anger , grief . 
dh : whoa , you trained . 
recording : okay , it &apos;s all about this . 
ok , this is severin hacker . 
leaders are there to be a charisma . 
well , mike , thank you very much . 
maybe , just maybe , would be less . 
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes . 
i believe it . i believe that too . 
and think , &quot; ha ha ha . 
so diabetes is one of the big diseases . 
and if you &apos;re happy with that , you &apos;re fantastic . 
people guard when other guests . 
and suddenly , from chaos : order . 
and yes , the red planet is red . 
let me explain to you how this works . 
sometimes you think i &apos;m deaf . 
couldn &apos;t do it . couldn &apos;t wait . 
and that was the language of war . 
so these are the three a &apos;s . 
and we know there &apos;s more . 
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy . 
there are different ways of doing that . 
let &apos;s see what it looks like . 
sometimes you have to lose to win . 
i didn &apos;t know what to do . 
they want to let people live in fear . 
and i thought , &quot; well , hey ! 
that &apos;s a challenge , i like that . 
and then you ask , why economists ? 
tm : oh , 10 , 11 . 
it &apos;s really cool , at least theoretical . 
this is a way of seeing things . 
it &apos;s just about having more and more . 
first of all , listen to the bomb . 
and i think that &apos;s a mistake . 
it &apos;s about how we feed them . 
sure , a shopping therapy could help . 
so you can imagine how this works . 
but i knew i had to change myself . 
that &apos;s , i think , wrong . 
but here &apos;s what &apos;s really going on . 
that &apos;s what we all need to do . 
they were not ready to go in . 
now i know you don &apos;t think that . 
they want us to fit in a better way . 
invest , invest , invest . &quot; 
okay . that &apos;s mt . everest . 
red means they &apos;re compelling . 
if they were to say , you know what ? 
some people say it doesn &apos;t look good . 
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment . 
and that &apos;s the next work . 
and the same thing is true for the troops . 
they &apos;re scaling . they &apos;re playing street games . 
i said , &quot; it &apos;s very beautiful . 
this is what i &apos;m working on right now . 
i think a lot of people have difficulty with this . 
richard preston , thank you very much . 
i think that &apos;s how we became human . 
we have to spin it up and down . 
it &apos;s extremely practical , but it &apos;s not great . 
good for you . you make a lot of money . 
and that &apos;s exactly the symbol of our world . 
it &apos;s bad , but there are places like this . 
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read . 
i need two people to help me quickly . 
he said , &quot; you &apos;re the bridge . &quot; 
so , how big is infinity ? 
then the united states today , up here . 
and he put the two in his office . 
i think in poland that &apos;s the same . 
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot; 
you have stress , you meditate a little bit . 
okay , somebody said &quot; five . &quot; 
ok , the parachute is disrupt . 
so , this is basically not like anything . 
we &apos;re going to learn to make a flap . 
it &apos;s finally . harmony is infinity . 
it &apos;s too late . it &apos;s over . 
and she said , &quot; what ? &quot; 
the schools need you . the teachers need you . 
where you might have the security to play . 
it &apos;s very hard . it &apos;s very hard . 
in fact , it &apos;s going up . 
here were children born , people died there . 
well , we have an argument for that . 
we were in the mountains , 1976 . 
let &apos;s see what people think about this . 
if you don &apos;t believe me , you ask sam . 
and nano , bang , $ 2,000 . 
there &apos;s nothing we don &apos;t know . 
you will be your country . you will be your religion . 
i think i just find information interesting . 
pretty much everyone else who &apos;s making surveys . 
okay , so a second , this is good . 
not acceptable . nepriemliv . 
it was a way of localizing myself . 
and that &apos;s the question that this song asks . 
they &apos;re not just possible , they &apos;re critical . 
is it corruption that poverty or something else ? 
second , because we &apos;ve eradicated it . 
they look like , maybe sunflowers . 
and is it easy to raise money ? 
i think that won &apos;t go anywhere . 
it would be great if the story ended here . 
difficult , right ? it &apos;s meaningless . 
we &apos;re just happy when things are fine . 
pm : well , that &apos;s a good idea . 
we &apos;re going to fly where the methane is . 
a government that depends only on the population . 
one is the mother , one from the father . 
i &apos;ll come up again , but not for air . 
and look what wal-mart has done . 
oh , after you stopped paying . 
i mean , they did everything for this woman . 
admittedly , i was such a child . 
the thing is , this is not google . 
we have one of these . it &apos;s really cool . 
but everything in everything is fine . 
hi . i &apos;m hasan . i &apos;m an artist . 
i think i have to say goodbye . 
now , try to grasp that . 
now , what is the meaning of these mirror neurons ? 
so i want to talk about how everything started . 
let me tell you , the best thing is . 
and i &apos;ll show you what we &apos;ve developed . 
i think architecture actually depends on it . 
that &apos;s exactly what people said to sue . 
there &apos;s more of that than you really want to think . 
i think that &apos;s a fundamental interesting question . 
this is the first invention i wanted to describe . 
well , go to the real atmosphere of this planet . 
it will stop because we have the resources . 
right . because i don &apos;t even touch it . 
e : quak , quak , quak . 
let me show you what you can do right now . 
and that &apos;s because there is no one . 
you think a punishment is a little bad . 
well , the thing has benefits and offtages . 
let me tell you what i came up with . 
purchase content and pure form , by the way . 
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental . 
well , i &apos;ll jump a little forward . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to show you now . 
this is very important , survival to us . 
and just down the street , you see jet . 
well , i thought that &apos;s not good enough . 
serious problems , big problems , urgent problems . 
i knew the woman i wanted to take . 
the older you get , the more common it gets . 
they &apos;re a good person . they complain . 
we &apos;re also waiting for the slower . ok . 
there &apos;s no patents . everybody can do it . 
well , recently , there were advances in this area . 
when he was digging , he never failed . 
i realize that &apos;s ambiguous . 
i &apos;m here today to challenge people . 
the pockets , the carrots . 
but we saw what that leads to . 
it was absolutely clear . i didn &apos;t have to think about it . 
voice 1 : it comes back . a new wave . 
i &apos;m actually done . science will never disappear . 
i believe there is such a solution . 
this is one of my favorite examples , belmar . 
and it was deep . deep inside my soul . 
in your and in mine and in those of our children . 
this is terrible , the whole oil in the water . 
three years , and today we can &apos;t do that anymore . 
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem . 
there are other ways of suppressing the system . 
or sneemobile . you don &apos;t need snow . 
you get an idea of where things come from . 
it &apos;s my passion to teach glc everywhere . 
they knew why they woke up in the morning . 
and the answer is not yet ; they &apos;re working . 
yeah , frisur -- i &apos;m standing on that . 
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is . 
as you can see , the tumor blows its eyes . 
i just thought money was going to do it already . 
inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is . 
you realize that these two things have to coexist . 
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot; 
so what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution . 
these places are the most important places that we need to protect . 
very strange , i &apos;ve analyzed it a few times . 
and if you can , just draw a pattern . 
we &apos;re interested in big , helle displays . 
it takes longer really . it takes five days . 
so , i have to adapt to something new . 
then , after a few weeks , we make camp . 
but really , independence was good for japan . 
and if you could do that , amazing things happen . 
i was in iraq , in afghanistan and in liberia . 
but they have no incentive to act like this . 
these are some pictures that visitors sent to me . 
message number three : don &apos;t go before you leave . 
we need a counter-templeton that emerges . 
they need to be alive , they need to feed . 
so this is the internet you have in your head . 
and there it was . his universe was on punch cards . 
the details that you can do today are amazing . 
energy is the most important thing , changing factor here . 
it &apos;s very bad . my brothers get everything . &quot; 
and -- oh , i saw goldie hawn . 
often it &apos;s sewage , which locks us . 
he &apos;s enjoying what the solist is playing . 
the other one , but he might see too many patterns . 
they found that they were worth two billion pounds . 
look at it first . look at it first . 
ok , they shaped her to stay there . 
it causes them to distort reality . 
well , the three sons started negotiating . 
this is my workplace . he &apos;s out there . 
they &apos;re not expensive , they &apos;re quite incommentible . 
and then we have silk , thai silk . 
the problem is that we can &apos;t afford that . 
why not ? i think that &apos;s pretty important . 
she said , &quot; change your profession . &quot; 
we know our societies need to radically change . 
that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot; 
i often talk about rethinking situations . 
now , i know that seems ridiculous . 
now , you think i &apos;m going to ask you some questions . 
here &apos;s the footage that i showed to people . 
you know why ? because this music expresses pain . 
bl : all right . one , two , three . 
people in white huts sailing boats . 
ears are not there to listen , but to listen . 
the more you play , the bigger your brain is . 
obviously an artist , she &apos;s a creative person . 
and win , even though the opponent has made more points . 
that was great because i had such sales . 
well , think of analogy of physical health . 
maybe people should save more if they make more money . 
and look , now the first african countries are coming in . 
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids . 
once it &apos;s finished , the installation is very simple . 
welfare , loving kindness , instead of hatred . 
they just want to do whatever they &apos;ve always done . 
imagine what it looks like . 
i want to tell you a few stories that explain my view . 
there &apos;s 100,000 . it would take a day long . 
you know , the system doesn &apos;t automatically happen . 
these cold , hard winter , i love it . 
but he doesn &apos;t get miracles just to admit . 
the short answer is , in fact , they &apos;re from japan . 
if the answer is yes , you have a good job . 
when i do my work , people hate me . 
we need to act as we move away from the future . 
why not ? i mean , we &apos;re doing it like this . 
and i often look at things like they were eating . 
and the more later it failed , the worse the impact . 
and if food isn &apos;t obvious , they take sex . 
it &apos;s kind of nice . what a wonderful design . 
great . cool . i was really worried about the amount . 
and it &apos;s not that my boys laugh me . 
with both hands , faster . yeah , good , good . 
now let me show you what it does to our societies . 
we want to eat them , not from their eaten . 
now , oh , yes , then further , further . 
ok , well , do you ever believe in hunting ? 
what you can see here is that it &apos;s going to vibrate . 
and ... society that we live in now . 
and what if , at all , do men do with it ? 
and we put great hopes in them . thank you very much . 
well , thank you all for having been there . 
what &apos;s necessary now is rebuilding the limits . 
when we &apos;re married , we have more kids . 
help cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m convinced . 
i wish we had the money and bigger resources . 
but we have hope again . we have a new man . 
it &apos;s very painful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything . 
the idea was to evacuate the target cities . 
in fact , consciousness is in the front lobe . 
100 million dollars -- hey , i can fly to the moon . 
and that &apos;s true , but there &apos;s more behind it . 
diving errors , you can exchange a part of them . 
don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work . 
these are the two concepts i &apos;d like to explore . 
and well , it &apos;s not much better now . 
animals might like to play , but they don &apos;t like to watch . 
ladies and gentlemen , this story hasn &apos;t been published yet . 
i don &apos;t know where julian morrow did this . 
beautiful , but again , a cheap trick , right ? 
that &apos;s it . and you wouldn &apos;t know it . 
there is , for example , the shape of noora . 
it seemed like the means of bringing both of us together . 
and i came across the maps that you see here . 
no , because the wind should get the trouble . 
milo : i wonder how deep it is . 
but remember , there &apos;s greece today . 
and they asked if they could send me a sphere . 
all i have to do is follow humility . 
ok , this is the slide of &quot; healing . &quot; 
you know , i was sitting at home , and i looked at it . 
and so we are thrilled to pray ourselves . 
i designed the process that generated shape . 
people were writing me to get prints of it . 
but actually , i &apos;m here today to tell a story . 
now , to the cow model , which i talked about . 
i designed it to help children with treatment . 
&quot; aha ! &quot; says the princess . 
so we don &apos;t think of anything as what it really is . 
but i wanted to show him something that enriched him . 
gut feeling , that &apos;s what we &apos;re using . &quot; 
we hope to build this up to the fall . 
but that &apos;s surprising again . you don &apos;t expect that . 
answer : &quot; dr. barnett , you &apos;re right . &quot; 
here &apos;s a female who has a gear . 
twenty-five percent say , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot; 
right , quite right . i &apos;m not a victim anymore . 
nobody tried it before , so i &apos;ll try it . 
you have to be able to do that kind of right , rosie . 
and so it &apos;s done . slice for shit . 
if you did that , the rest of yourself runs . 
if you don &apos;t know one of the languages , you &apos;ll learn immediately . 
you can stand out , but not the managers . 
for them , that was the kind of attention she needed . 
we thought a patient would also like to understand the context . 
that , all these bad news , can be avoided . 
remember history ? no , it &apos;s big . 
there was never a company that doesn &apos;t have competition . 
i juble because it &apos;s still in my body . 
in order to rule that , you needed a whole concept . 
these are the classic conditions that lead to regret . 
and i realized it was ok to go . 
we understand the software programs that control our bodies . 
it &apos;s certainly what i learned during my education . 
so , this device is an optical tarncap . 
something that goes back to something more fundamental . 
if i pick up the pile , i &apos;ll lend it . 
you &apos;ve heard of it . you know what that means . 
but making this in a conventional way is difficult . 
that there is a movement that is looking for better solutions . 
so the piece of art was to assemble those two pages . 
i was lying on a thin , hard special bed . 
zoom ahead of scale , we see a human hair . 
but it &apos;s hard to hear the words out loud . 
what they found was wrong with labels of fish . 
i really think that there would be roots there . 
half of them deserved to look for gold . 
i couldn &apos;t wait to solve the amazing mind . 
that means that we &apos;ll get our new hips free . 
we have names for places where there are no people . 
believe it or not , some of us survive it . 
so , we know that this wasn &apos;t a cheap war . 
&quot; what shall i say ? &quot; i said . 
and that somehow leads to intelligent behavior predictions . 
some of the studies actually demonstrate that we are happier . 
and that &apos;s what leads to the first step here . 
you fly from the island , when you get a disease . 
so eight of us went in , four men and four women . 
and then it &apos;s time to treat them again . last year . 
and most people say , &quot; ok , i play . &quot; 
helium has to spread , therefore , shape . 
and we need to think about how we can effectively design this . 
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of . 
and when she came to the house , she was greeted . 
and that seems to be all that we &apos;re currently worried about . 
and i said , &quot; yeah , like the humane society . 
my son says he &apos;s not ready to marry . 
so i thought it would be good to start with it . 
it takes a second , but it &apos;s excellent . 
i &apos;ll come up there , and there &apos;s a vault . 
i didn &apos;t deserve it ; i don &apos;t deserve anything . 
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to finish before time . 
imagine driving into the vacation . 
to stand up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean violence . 
and frankly , i &apos;m on huge benefits . 
now , the equivalent of a snob is your mother . 
it lasts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium . 
took pictures of me collected how mothers did this . 
they were interested in health , they were interested in education . 
remember , we don &apos;t all have a photograph . 
and yes , she was too old for fourth grade . 
i mean , really hard , information seems to be our best hope . 
but we don &apos;t use them . the numbers are just lying around like this . 
that &apos;s the pure truth , the righteous truth . 
and if you do that , i &apos;m standing in line . 
and when someone tells you that you feel weird . 
we &apos;ve heard of amish giving up cars . 
we need to know why people do what they do . 
i became teamchapters , and that was great . 
you &apos;ve heard about dna , maybe biology . 
i &apos;m an ecologist , and i &apos;m studying complexity . i like complexity . 
some people will try to motivate others for their team . 
all of this can happen if we don &apos;t take the problem seriously . 
this is normal dna , which you think is normal dna . 
i do all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible . 
frankly , better or worse ? say , &quot; yes . &quot; 
it &apos;s hard to appreciate because there are different motives . 
and the answer , of course , is , &quot; they don &apos;t . &quot; 
ts : yeah , we take some canvas . 
i know what you &apos;re thinking when you look at these pictures . 
if you zoom closer than that , look like this . 
they &apos;re not just going to change , from now to afterwards . 
they lived above the businesses they were working in . 
it &apos;s different in the market , and here &apos;s a few . 
it &apos;s hard for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die . 
these are just some examples that teach us traditional societies . 
in fact , i wanted to be a pop star . 
and the answer is , if you open enough of that -- yes . 
so , to tms , you have to say a few words . 
when the mission was over , they landed on the thing . 
bf : 10 years of perfection you &apos;re going to experience . 
we don &apos;t think cameras are good at apartments . 
and we found that we can measure this very precisely . 
what have i learned from this case ? well , three things . 
fireworks . the smell of a parking , no . 
i see , there &apos;s a lot of work that comes up to me . 
it makes sense to think about an analogy with language . 
and that leads to the final point , which is to our elections . 
colin camerer : neuroscience , theory of play 
imagine if you were all participating in this study . 
i suspect there &apos;s a lot of animals that are harvesting . 
it &apos;s a compiled , curved inside . 
i thought about building my own little rockets . 
imagine creating all of our hard materials like this . 
i was 27th , i thought i knew everything . 
we discovered that they worked alone by intermolecular forces . 
so , here it is about state budgets . 
value means good or bad or positive or negative . 
this is the region where entropy is low . 
but the gene that regulates is damaged . 
but we feel the same thing could work in other places . 
it &apos;s really cold . it &apos;s 7,300 feet . 
it &apos;s this brain that triggers this reflex . 
every day it took a lot of hours to improve my skills . 
this is the planet we &apos;ve played all the way up to now . 
we talked about mobility , now we talk about health . 
it turns out that different tasks are actually interdependent . 
and we will live in a peaceful world . thank you very much . 
and i think that &apos;s not a gumi at all . 
so i decided to study the economics of terror . 
so we have these fingertips , other dinosaurs . 
i work to break this sense of elitism . 
now it goes down to the a , the g and the f . 
a boy should have gone . we can &apos;t do that . &quot; 
it &apos;s more than a device ; it &apos;s renewable . 
i didn &apos;t want them to be threatening or dangerous . 
it doesn &apos;t have to look like this , it actually looks like this today . 
i don &apos;t know if i can explain that even more clearly . 
i see a lot of kids . they come up and down . 
what i often do is public private partnerships . 
i &apos;m going to spend money on that . i have a better idea . 
they &apos;re adapting to me so i &apos;m not making a pinpoint . 
but when i was thinking about other things , it was very simple things . 
and this is now more realistic than it has been for decades . 
and this is , in my view , an idea that deserves prevalence . 
these are things that are different for every patient . 
i certainly wasn &apos;t prepared for what was next . 
but it &apos;s also clear that wealth means more than that . 
so we can study it as a physical , intuitive model . 
we don &apos;t really have the right words to describe them . 
right ? a patient holding the tax , for example . 
and if we throw the ballast over the bord , we &apos;ll go up . 
while he did , he noticed an unexpected thing . 
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re confined at the moment . 
oxygen , hydrogen and zincs have their own signatures . 
we suspect maize has its origin in in in of mexico . 
look , it &apos;s not as dramatic as the tsunami . 
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites . 
and what &apos;s even more important is they &apos;re well-dressed . 
we explained to them that we &apos;ll send number three to them . 
and to go one step further , we have a heart here . 
this is how often they take the first best that offers them . 
so i think we have a completely false editing behavior . 
i want to encourage you to expand your horizon . 
and that means we need to increase efficiency . 
i guess you can only have a miracle per building . 
this is not the only place we &apos;ve had interventions . 
this is a film we &apos;ve heard a lot about . 
this understanding of chemistry can help us , in our everyday lives . 
i wrote the book because i wanted to find out something about life . 
in fact , it was also the answer of aristotle . 
look at what happens when your foot is on your sandwich . 
they have special interest in technologies that are going to help our soldiers . 
and i think he was right with this , almost a decade ago . 
so , these two inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity . 
you know , an audience like you , yes , is the show . 
these are the foundations of my device , or of our apparatus . 
they want order to also cost those who are at the bottom . 
the future is , as we know , very unpredictable . 
okay , i just switched around , that was just 20 seconds . 
there are no light sources except those that we bring . 
if they &apos;re bad , they caused it . learn from it . 
instead of investing in a car , we &apos;re now investing in the community . 
they &apos;re beautiful designed to simply use and user friendly . 
i go back and forth , i &apos;m not getting anywhere . 
so we &apos;re starting to pay money that we really have . 
and we decided to use recipes to this cause . 
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , everybody knows that . 
ben saunders : yeah , hi , ben saunders . 
yes , no way of proving that they &apos;re at all here . 
it didn &apos;t matter if i wasn &apos;t going to create peace day . 
i see this word , i hear this word , i feel this word everywhere . 
because it &apos;s going to lead me to the internet where i can reach everyone . 
yeah , yeah , back to the corner . back to the corner . 
&quot; what &apos;s love ? &quot; &quot; wrote shakespeare . 
722 is 500 -- oh , that &apos;s a more difficult one . 
i think many of you are probably there . 
this was one of the biggest factories i &apos;d ever seen . 
please think that these people are otherwise completely normal . 
of course , that &apos;s because climate change has so good images . 
bf : that &apos;s ok , that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing . all right . 
a couple of them . this is attila the henne . 
if you have the second side here , you left one the most . 
what would it do ? i think infrastructure could solve the problem . 
they had to measure the milk and then mix it . 
we hired the citizens first place , not the officials . 
here &apos;s another interesting example in seoul , korea . 
not the painter , i don &apos;t want to think about the painter . 
in fact , it &apos;s basically the same way in the 14th century . 
some of them are already available in the upper half . 
because there &apos;s nothing in there . well , supposedly there is nothing here . 
so in 1997 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s bring the women together . 
armies use it when they &apos;ve lost a battle . 
bl : that &apos;s the concept of technology . all right . 
wrong . i don &apos;t look at you . i can &apos;t see you . 
and now we see that the change in japan was enormously . 
and some people think that we &apos;re born in a different way . 
so , aicha , did you have some final words ? 
its strength depends on the ability to make other people strong . 
master sounds so silly , but that &apos;s what it was . 
if you &apos;re in this framework , you take some theoretics . 
but they did well by adapting to india . 
we have pretty bad secular , i would say . 
after he died , i realized nobody was writing me anymore . 
so , &quot; i saw a lot of trains as well as a danger . 
a few friends and i found out how to do it . 
i invite the bad pictures up too , because they are . 
and this came from here , shrimp farms . 
where is art ? there is productivity , there is sports . 
that means that our bacteria actually lived on phthalates . 
so he was convinced , but in fact , most people are not . 
there is no doubt in my understanding that this is going to happen . 
in fact , you can see that every logo is a little different . 
nigerian filmmakers really do what they like . 
it &apos;s our belief , and we &apos;ll keep it true . &quot; 
we can increase the volume if this is possible . 
but , oh , the killers are in the camps . 
players are asked to be very creative in this game . 
the threat is serious , and we need to prepare now . 
the other partners we have are corporations and communities . 
indisappeared , untangible , unraveled . 
i think these are the foundations of peace in the future . 
but it took 24 years to succeed . 
but they can show you how to build things in a sequence . 
so , i managed to stumble a adulterer . 
this is a picture that was taken on the summit ridge . 
make it go away . make it go away . &quot; 
the bad news is that it &apos;s rocket fuel . 
i was doing a studio , trying to publish my work . 
the second reason is , i think , is political correctness . 
and we nurture them together , like medieval monks . 
so , what do i discover when i look at artworks ? 
the irony of the thing is they don &apos;t have to be . 
and even more shocking , they &apos;re from what he says . 
they don &apos;t experience the fiction the way we would . &quot; 
this is something that you can be very , very optimistic about . 
there are three obvious ways that you can do this . 
anyway , i &apos;m going to ask you to convey those values together with me . 
let &apos;s take out those who say they &apos;re saving too little . 
i go over and do as if it &apos;s iran . 
but i can &apos;t stop thinking about these young people without poor . 
i think there is a story there that needs to be told . 
there &apos;s a jewish saying i love . 
when you pump a bicycle , you use some of it . 
there are all these different ways , but they &apos;re different effective . 
hi . this guy believes here , he can tell you the future . 
door , door , door , color , you know what i mean . 
and he was mad . he was really . he had a clue . 
and the joke is , of course , not just walking in the market . 
he &apos;s called &quot; the sentence &quot; because he &apos;s there . &quot; 
in 24 months , people can turn into space . 
it &apos;s really hurting . we &apos;re still amplifying it , right ? 
then you test this new hypothesis , and so on and so forth . 
but i want to tell you a story to illustrate that . 
well , the reason is there &apos;s not enough donor circles . 
and all they can contribute to prevalence is great . 
it didn &apos;t happen because an incredibly clever human being had said that . 
it &apos;s so beautiful as &quot; a &quot; on , &quot; i guess . 
but there &apos;s a number of other people you don &apos;t know . 
so , the house is no longer designed for the invasion . 
the dutch people are good , but the italians are good . 
and that was also good that you supported the thing . 
in the beginning , you &apos;ll see that the inspiration remains stable . 
i think i &apos;ve never been so happy in my entire life . 
&quot; no , my daughter , she comes with the buick . 
it was the extension of human intelligence , so it was called it . 
here &apos;s a design that distillates water with the sun . 
so let &apos;s try and ask a question that is busy with health . 
they are what we have on our fields every year around the world . 
so there are lots of examples like this that we &apos;ve talked about . 
and we even know something about the way our brain does this . 
they complained prizes , and i don &apos;t know any time . 
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat . 
it basically means being human , and doing the right thing . 
it &apos;s all so clear , but it urges it . &quot; 
look , the world has changed from analog to digital . 
and once that happens , a moment that goes into the robot . 
and once that thing started , there was no more return . 
it &apos;s a human dream of flying like a bird . 
they &apos;re interconnected , so you can &apos;t separate them . 
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can . 
every year it &apos;s 7,000 -- people who get the first time . 
i can see my work as a job , i &apos;ll do it for money . 
it &apos;s a logical plan , but it &apos;s not always been that way . 
yeah , i thought that . we all know that , right ? 
so this is the hangover that we &apos;re trying to detect patterns . 
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the cleverness of sheep . 
she didn &apos;t want to eat . she didn &apos;t want to sleep . she didn &apos;t want a sex . 
i don &apos;t think that just by itself we can solve this problem . 
we study for three reasons , the weakest one is curiosity . 
it &apos;s on the planet since the beginning of animals , 500 million years . 
it &apos;s not the first time we &apos;re experiencing a technical revolution . 
and for the first time in three generations , his kids would go to school . 
hold it , hold it , hold it , both hold it . 
the problem is that there are very complicated forces in the climate system . 
i &apos;m afraid big . i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be able to do it . 
but we have a problem of perception , many just don &apos;t get it . 
if you move the mouse on the computer , the arrow moves . 
it &apos;s always the same , never the same , endless fascinating . 
i love to hear about all this species on the bottom of the ocean . 
this is a fundamental property that we use with our technology . 
ok , oil policy is very morally imposed in the u.s . 
so here i actually have -- i know exactly where the cards are . 
mr. teszler put 16 men , eight white , eight black men . 
in fact , we &apos;re doing this . the fact is not very much . 
the girls who were terrified in my territorial appearance . 
when i do something that hurt you , i feel pain . 
i turn the shoe and try to slow down . 
that &apos;s what your office should look like , that &apos;s part of my argument . 
i wrote this entry , and i took it because of einstein today . 
when i make some money , i &apos;m going to make one for myself . 
and it doesn &apos;t fit to the future that we &apos;re moving towards . 
the investments are flowing into telecommunications , shopping centers . 
the first one is , again , think about this , is four year-olds . 
i delivered 70-year-old women who were playing bridge . 
and this is the front door that &apos;s taken over your computer . 
i think you can teach crows to do other things . 
when it comes to our stories , we love to be wrong . 
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw nice cartoons . 
teacher : now it &apos;s different in both directions . look what happens . 
so , it &apos;s about a mile in diameter , 200 meters deep . 
if we can do that , forget the molecular details . 
on the internet , there are videos full length , if you &apos;re interested . 
in fact , we believe that the future of events is happening . 
i repeat ; the unexpected one , which is raw too . 
move your eyes , blink it , close your eye . 
this is the view right across the street from where they were . 
and someone else has one thing that is the complete opposite of her . 
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not true : feeling and feeling . 
that &apos;s what business is doing by getting profits . 
they kind of don &apos;t seem sexy and elegant , they hide . 
by the way , these are my children , which are , of course , wonderful and so on . 
all the books are sold in the store . near the plank . 
so i &apos;m going to show you this , we &apos;re just going to play a long time . 
so if anyone wants to copy us , come and power , come on . 
and he asked this particular person what crows and fish have in common . 
and since then , it has become more , we haven &apos;t had the numbers yet . 
the robot is obviously able to do every railway curve . 
nobody should know that i was a girl , and nobody knew it . 
now , you could say that it doesn &apos;t really look different from the beginning . 
now -- it &apos;s in this condition , we have a lot to do . 
among other things , we know that they &apos;re mostly really hard to overcome . 
but it &apos;s the common action of us that makes change . 
and they &apos;re paid for it . you can think about it if you want it . 
but the real projections for this , i would spend in about this . 
not because we &apos;re going to wind and build necessary . 
we really expected that stars can &apos;t stand in this environment . 
politicians in a big , complex , tricky item project ? 
she was smiling . she couldn &apos;t understand why i was so worried . 
i don &apos;t have to worry in my age where the bridge is going . 
we didn &apos;t think there would be so many maps around the world . 
it will let us question what it means to be a human . 
the middle income countries , the emerging markets , they pick up . 
there is no dog all over the world that &apos;s natural origin . 
this is the skyline of doha , which is probably most of you here . 
and that it &apos;s capable of doing this peaceful . 
no ceo , no executive company to create it . 
and then like karajan . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ? 
and i know you &apos;re all thinking about dodgeball teams now . 
or you can go back and change altitude . now , skill . 
these are the robes that make the animal go like this . 
so the ability to just wrap the tube from the outside . 
an example , a great example , is the danger of smoking . 
and suddenly , without knowing it , you see the world differently . 
she said she was &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot; 
the architectural translation was , in fact , simple . 
just throw over board , like ballast , to change our direction . 
obviously , the product we want to be innocent for people . 
the environments that we live in , usually look like this . 
it was time when all the big species came up . 
and then they say , oh yeah , constant acceleration . 
they didn &apos;t kill them , they called us to catch them . 
whatever the future is , we should fight the &#91; cat &#93; . 
it can &apos;t afford to question that nursing person . 
we should probably slow down , and we should probably do that right now . 
of course , you know , and i know coca cola is the better choice . 
we look at the inside of the person who &apos;s lazy eggs . 
in order to succeed , i became pretty good at finding new ideas . 
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . 
it &apos;s not that she &apos;s guaranteing peace on the outside . 
the rules i mean are constantly monitored by our culture . 
by the way , we looked back at what we saw . 
and i think it all fits much better if you do this . 
our first year , the first net in october 2003 went from the band . 
and this cell is one of the thousands of different cell types that we &apos;re learning from . 
let me show you this , i &apos;m going to start with the standard method . 
and the danger is that you can create a pandemic . 
and in total , we had no idea if we could do it . 
when other people see my tattoo , they usually like what it looks like . 
i have to say , at the time , i couldn &apos;t even find the bird , really . 
and then of course , there is climate change , and we all know climate change . 
everybody &apos;s a sun with a group of planets that circle them around . 
no , i was quiet because i didn &apos;t get the truth . 
and if it &apos;s a good story , it may even make us smile . 
let &apos;s go back a few years and see what was going on then . 
okay , see ? that &apos;s it . almost finished . there &apos;s wires . 
and finally , there are radio waves whose problems i &apos;ve already mentioned . 
and here it comes up to us , the first steps to a wall . 
and in two hours after their back were broken , they were transformed . 
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to people in the field . 
and then i &apos;m going to show you that it &apos;s actually much more complicated . 
so , that &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from there . 
many of us here have made this decision , and it &apos;s really not hard . 
the first tip is obviously the leg that &apos;s hitting the load cell . 
so david , in history , should be the underlying , right ? 
so the law can be the basis of freedom , to have it to trust people . 
most education games , which are actually reading cards . 
with a thousand julians working together , mexico would be a very different country . 
this is our last number , and nat will play on the piano . 
there are important consequences of distribution , but other than you would expect . 
now , not all of these attempts to do big of love works well . 
they &apos;ve been building for so long that i don &apos;t know where it is . 
animation , software , filmmaking programs , they have all these things . 
so what i want to tell you about this is that we know child mortality . 
the region that looks like a horn , we call sweet spot . 
everybody , until chance . she didn &apos;t believe in the accident . 
i remember when i did that , and the compelling was open . 
crucial is never the resources ; it &apos;s &quot; resource evoll . &quot; 
i think we all have a vision for the health care system in this country . 
&quot; hah , i &apos;m the only one i ever loved . &quot; 
we stopped watering our ground as far as it was . 
it &apos;s our primary dad . well , that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about . &quot; 
and the man who gave the talk that night was very interesting . 
maybe these people are right . they may not be very good to think about their thoughts . 
don &apos;t stand rubble , don &apos;t sit down at cute altitude , none of it . 
if you &apos;re wired to do business , you do business . 
and i swam through the night , and also through the next day . 
because it meant that at least one person had understood me . thank you . 
and this is the first project i &apos;ve been working on . 
and specifically , i think we can learn something about learning . 
thank you very much for hearts . thank you . thank you chris . 
in fact , it was 15 centimeters bigger than i did , and it was so big . 
and what &apos;s interesting from my point of view , what does it mean to be disabled ? 
now , that &apos;s not true . you can do it through sweats . 
so we &apos;re always realizing that crows are really , really smart . 
people , this is not a simple metaphor that i &apos;m talking about , it &apos;s true . 
everything started seeds in a classroom that looks like this . 
instead of sending a product to the world , we send data on the internet . 
in the big and small , the story of victims is how we see women . 
and this is the dead head , the dead dead head . 
we work together whether side or distance is always important . 
cooking , polls , shopping , but they &apos;re not here . 
so this is the scenario that we should spend on capital . 
and second , i &apos;m not interested in the word , i &apos;m interested in how they use it . 
but that tells us how to look at it , and where we need to go . 
it &apos;s because we are women , because we love our children . 
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most importantly , behavior . 
and , like lots of bottles , you tell me i have a problem ? 
is it a year story , a decade story , or more ? 
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing and discussing ideas . 
this is a reporter that you can look online ; the video is online . 
i feel i &apos;d lost it for so many years . &quot; 
the problem is that there &apos;s nothing more to cancer in them . 
you meet some great people , people who see the world with very different eyes . 
all right . i go to the pharmacy , i &apos;m sick , and i need drugs . 
if you want to change the world , you need to form groups , collaborate . 
i &apos;m sure that &apos;s much easier than a school has learned mathematics . 
it &apos;s so obvious , sun-clear , and someone had to have had this idea . 
so you expect the future to be worse than it is actually . 
for the fourth time here , i think i &apos;m here for this wisdom . 
you can find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs and so forth . 
my father , who i talked about , died of aids in 1999 . 
now this is forbidden , and the sharks are certainly excited about this . 
and furthermore , they &apos;re able to walk across long stretches . 
but maybe it helps if i put him in the head a hole . &quot; 
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s penguin shit . &quot; 
what our sender does , it &apos;s what dirty jobs are doing . 
so the donors have to be engaged in the long term , at least for 10 years . 
you can think of it as the language of thoughts , or &quot; mentalese . &quot; 
your picture of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what shapes us . 
these systems that we made unprepared could be there before . 
what was killing us were not muslims , not the arabs . 
i mean , what &apos;s the probability that all 10 are willing to stop ? 
we humans are social , we &apos;re empathic , and that &apos;s great . 
and now comes the coast , and a very small part of me is sad . 
so it &apos;s not that my topic is the most important thing . it &apos;s not . 
what i mean is you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk . 
well , she &apos;s picked c , g , h , a , e . 
it &apos;s also what i &apos;m looking for in my work , in a personal sense . 
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he &apos;s armed . 
nr. 3 : the handouts you &apos;re giving is not your presentation . 
now , i was stupid , but not so stupid , to reject that . 
we use everything we have to influence it to get it to the table . 
well , i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old . 
and that would be the test for lip balding that we have over here . 
the cause of our worries is in the complexity that science has given us . 
this is woodhan , one of the biggest cities that was discovered . 
all the time i &apos;m on the lake , i don &apos;t usually see anybody . 
but i think we should also look at the numbers of what reality really looks like . 
it &apos;s a story that is a lightweight for teaching and teaching people . 
so , remember , this is an example that architecture actually has achieved something . 
i got angry . brothers can argue . parents and children can argue . 
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re the yearning that holds the troops together . 
she &apos;s ready to use those with begging , with other things . 
it tells a lot about the students they chose . 
she was like one of these women sitting behind the sewing machines , pretty similar . 
so i think i &apos;ll start with what i just heard . 
a package that changes color when your milk has gotten worse . 
but , everything doesn &apos;t matter if we don &apos;t make it protecting the oceans . 
that &apos;s all there is to say . apple patented this . 
can you imagine how you felt if you were in my place ? 
the real social innovation that i want to talk about is charity . 
it &apos;s made of two pieces that we call encoder and transducer . 
just kidding . nobody gets a cent , a euro or yen . 
and if we say , &quot; yes , we need more . it has to go on . &quot; 
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about this , and what scientists should do . 
it has a little bit to do with the last , but it &apos;s a lot of erotic . 
it &apos;s soluble , not democrat , not republicans . 
who &apos;s stopping and saying , oh , look , a cow ? nobody . 
the first thing he saw was a floating dish . 
i was asked to design a building because the issue of the expo were environmental problems . 
but she went to jupiter , saturn , uranus and nepples . 
last month i was at google , and wow , what a cafeteria cafeteria ! 
but now we need a new fire that makes us secure , healthy and consistent . 
you can see that the skaters are doing more here , and the obstacles are easier . 
yeah , that means i didn &apos;t have to draw gyeonghoeru . 
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s nonsense , steve . a stupid idea . 
as i said , you find them mostly in seals that are very , very small . 
so they don &apos;t have the means , nor the incentives , to attract more customers . 
and a hammer , when we reach a hammer , is what we take . 
rm : yeah , this is the first time we ever learned about it . 
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why context is everything . 
i don &apos;t want you to be raised by other students at school . &quot; 
one of them , in anthropology , is exploring human universals . 
it sets up a change , and what turns out is not software . 
he went down . he pulled a lever . and the chair went down . 
a long time ago , the world was once a big , heavy family . 
&quot; look . i had a dream too , but -- &quot; but . &quot; 
engineer : absolutely . interviewer : they thought , &quot; oh , mist . &quot; 
well , as anthropologists , we know that every culture has its origin story . 
but we don &apos;t know where , because we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern . 
that was bad ! man , i was -- i was hughted . i was sick . 
he wanted to try and visualize it , considering some basic principles . 
not the drugs themselves , but the care that is connected to it . 
and i was sure it would be great for democracy and for our society . 
the feeling that nobody &apos;s listening to me is very important in our relationship with technology . 
we were in the desert , in the wadi rum , in a small jeep . 
from the fact that they serve only an audience , mainly western culture . 
as it copies , one of the billions of spros , errors a mistake . 
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to occupy the light census . 
the laws of physics : invisible , forever , ubiquitous , ubiquitous . 
this is the work of quentin lindsey , which is a ph.d . 
and in some ways , the music that they just wrote was perfect for these places . 
so i &apos;m going to tell you some amazing things that happened when we started it . 
work with , come to the safe place , and let &apos;s move something . 
today , in sweden and other industries , people are using so many different machines . 
and that kept going until i decided to do it full-time . 
the fact that there are exceptions here doesn &apos;t touch that at least . 
leibniz was the first person to actually talk about building such a machine . 
the wonder of your mind is not that you can see the world as it is . 
the people who are interested in this class usually have a hacker mentality . 
suzanne , very quickly , what you got , don &apos;t you randomly dreamt ? 
so when i was thinking about it , i suddenly realized that biology gave us the answer . 
we &apos;re learning how to communicate with them in very high-frequent kills . 
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . really bad . don &apos;t look at me . 
it &apos;s the wrong way of teaching kids that they can &apos;t make mistakes . 
every vacation i had as a young boy , i spent national parks . 
i hope you respect my soldiers , this soldier with this pipe . 
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , and it &apos;s going to be shocked . 
that means , you know , you have no power whatsoever to change anything . 
so , that &apos;s 20 micrometers on average , that pollen grain there . 
i mean , what if you had a nose surgery , and you like the result ? 
i don &apos;t mean we &apos;ve come together to join huge organized religions . 
and is it about art , imagine what is beyond the horizon ? 
and he said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m teaching a school of art . 
i think i couldn &apos;t take your cell phone away , even if i wanted it . 
and yes , they also interact with the normal gestures , both hands , and so on . 
i think it exists , and we need to look for it , and it &apos;s below the surface . 
and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , which is -- a personal expression , a note . 
and when that happens , of course , conditions improve , and they drive rocks . 
think about how the word &quot; yo &quot; is used when teenagers speak today . 
that meant my dream of becoming a teacher wouldn &apos;t go fulfillment . 
i think most people in the industry realize that we need to embrace this problem . 
first of all , when it goes wrong , we begin to see the meaning of families for children . 
this is something that we &apos;ve known for a while , so it &apos;s not incremental . 
but since i had no family asking for me , they could do everything with me . 
you all know how this is ; you don &apos;t need disability to understand this . 
well , the answer may seem that the universe can create complexity , but with great difficulty . 
in order to realize that , we needed a study , like a magic trick . 
dl : however , we lose time , i &apos;ll get to the point . 
now , since you &apos;re done with this , you close it , because every cell phone has one in common . 
you know what you &apos;re winning on one side , you &apos;re losing on the other . 
and of course , everybody understood it . everybody said , &quot; yes , of course , they &apos;re right . 
and a social movement consists , in my eye , is made of four key characteristics . 
it was at that moment when we realized that it would actually work . 
it &apos;s not just something that supports trees , it &apos;s something that connects people and nations . 
the future of these communities lies in their people and in our ability to work with these people . 
so he wants to get money from my mother when she comes out , but she doesn &apos;t have enough . 
boone , i &apos;m really excited that you were here to be in this conversation . 
normal . let &apos;s go to schools , something i &apos;m actually a specialist . 
but basically , it was difficult . it was really hard to explain how the web would be . 
from 100 incarcerts left , 60 will be prone back . 
and i said , &quot; yeah . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot; 
so i certainly can say , &quot; i think i am . &quot; 
we can tell our kids , ok , done , that &apos;s our story . that &apos;s over . 
i &apos;m sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to offer $ 100 , 200 dollars . 
one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you . &quot; 
i &apos;m here to suggest something better , which is that less maybe it is . 
and you know , we have a society , a world that is primarily afraid . 
the only two conditions were that they were studying at university , and they were speaking english . 
mobbing is a disease . prejudice are a disease . violence is a disease . 
now , if you want to represent this zero and one of the binary , you need a device . 
tell us what we &apos;re wrong . let &apos;s talk about where religion says . &quot; 
but the problem is , you get hungry , it &apos;s just hard to ignore . 
i ask you , in the name of these children , their faces you see -- they &apos;re not there anymore . 
and i mean , &quot; look , don &apos;t worry , don &apos;t get it . 
el niño comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster ; it &apos;s a rhythm . 
keien time . here , i have two minutes , so we can &apos;t do that . 
this picture is actually quite interesting , because we did it , i think , three years ago . 
to make them really stereotype , let &apos;s say they &apos;re both white men . 
for me , this was the space of space , which was not what robot could not do yet . 
well , because time here is limited , i just want to focus on three strategies . 
blue cheese , ranch , essig and oil , thousand island and house . 
i was also fortunate that my mother did something that most women don &apos;t do . 
we think the sales are high , but the entries are actually going to be even bigger . 
how humans get to this music , how it happens in their lives , that fascinates me . 
the animal could be a cow , a lamb , or something more exotic . 
and what has changed is something that you don &apos;t expect in art , which is mathematics . 
anyway , thank you very much for having allowed me to speak here . 
but the truth is that these crazy cases are relatively rare , they won &apos;t win most of the time . 
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended . 
this is the time between , time when the direction of the moon changes . 
one is that people need insurance that they &apos;re not thrown out . 
and this is probably because we haven &apos;t seen it as we do today . 
all right . small fire on ice . tell them not to kill me . 
look at these young bosons that are moving to catch the light . 
i think that &apos;s the first step in this direction . that &apos;s the slow time frame . 
you can add them proteins that light up when you light them up . 
if you &apos;re in the desert , they can communicate with each other to about two kilometers wide . 
and what &apos;s even more disturbing is what happens with younger buttons . 
and if we do what we &apos;ve discovered , the circuit changes . 
usually , it &apos;s 90 percent . so , you tell me you &apos;re more likely to sleep than you &apos;re expecting . 
companies don &apos;t get profit , not in the original sense , by causing social problems . 
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and recognize the skill of perceiving failure . 
so again , what we focus on is more prevention than treatment , first of all . 
neighborhoods . yemen , civil war . united arab emirate , money . 
so i found it very amazing to bump into an organization that would value both sides . 
it allows us to create art , biotechnology , software and all such wonderful things . 
&quot; we don &apos;t have competition . there &apos;s nobody ever made a device like this . &quot; 
and once a poison is in the food chain , all of it is affected , it &apos;s also us . 
now , that &apos;s not necessarily what you think of before you buy a condom . 
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them . 
we &apos;re also going to see that these kids have a real opportunity to overcome their poverty . 
you can go right now . it &apos;s all free . we try not to sell anything . 
this is a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . this was fantastic . 
well , since i don &apos;t see any signs , it seems to be true what i &apos;m saying . 
so , dan , first of all , do you want to tell everybody hi hi here and tell who you are ? 
because , as i said , we live in networks , and these networks have a certain kind of structure . 
but we thought , ok , if we have to do it already , then in the library . 
and , by the way , i call them the eleanor roosevelt of the right . 
the idea is so simple , obviously , but the implications are going to be really extensive . 
you have to say , well , for the darkness of the skin , you shouldn &apos;t have to suffer . 
they &apos;re too frightened . they &apos;re too frightened . no . stop . 
i know there was a big hype to control our ability to control biology . 
and i want you to release out the negative energy by shaking it . 
what you see when you look at the title called &quot; pm car . &quot; 
we need a practice . framework conditions to learn how to become more remarkable . 
and so he &apos;s standing there , he &apos;s keeping the bed right , because the bed just doesn &apos;t work . 
so , if you look at this little script here , the speed is always 30 . 
in order to shrink history , i decided that i had to go back and do it . 
and if you see it diagonal , you get content and shape -- and then beauty and truth . 
the question is , how do you find something new that has been around for about 5,000 years ? 
how do we do that ? well , we use a model system that we call protocell . 
it &apos;s a customer , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person involved . 
and since i have a 15-year-old at home , i have to cook all the time , cooking . 
if you look out the window , you can see long &apos;s peak . you probably know that . 
the group that i &apos;d like to look at is , but people are at the bottom , are the footpeople . 
and where it doesn &apos;t do , like in the greenth winter , mars is not far . 
uncle drinks , doesn &apos;t use condom . come back , start again . &quot; 
they asked me what i wanted to be , and then they told me what to be . 
no buttons or trains that you need to emphasize , just me and play . 
and i mean , seriously , i think we should just make it clear and move on . 
i mean , your hometown called literally whitesville , west virginia . 
i &apos;m going to show income per capita income on this axis , arm down there , rich up here . 
when the first computers came to market , they were told that they were a million times faster than neurons . 
but for every disaster we had , the marathon found a way to bring people together . 
that &apos;s the bad news , but perhaps surprisingly , it &apos;s also part of the good news . 
and there are three ways that these massive passive data can be used . 
and i was so excited , the first one i saw outside ebbets field . 
but no , for the protest , they all dressed in white with no makeup . 
some of the teenagers said the car was actually five meters away than the chiss fell . 
it &apos;s not that i think spoken word poetry is the ideal art form . 
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to send aid , sisters and doctors to help us . 
i mean , singapore is a world nation , ghana , but not . 
some are driven by compassion , think it might be one of the fundamental acts of humanity . 
and there are people who are using these computers to practice their officials . 
if you jumped like this , imagine what you were breeding . 
i had learned to read notes , forced to learn it slowly . 
i have a solution that doesn &apos;t require anything , firewood , still gas . 
he said , &quot; no , shredded , i &apos;m not going anywhere . 
we show portal because you shoot walls to create new spaces . 
and i met julius the last week where i lived in kibera . 
invest the time , and the energy they have to spend with their loved ones ? 
this concept of peers , inc . it &apos;s a very difficult and complex area . 
the country that &apos;s on top of itself is a place where i haven &apos;t been . 
more crime . we looked at everything , aids infectious , flu , etc . 
the evolution of dinosaurs was slowly slowing down , no matter how they measure it . 
finally , some people say , well , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells . i &apos;m conscious . 
sustainable energy is the biggest problem we have to solve this century , independent of environmental problems . 
said , you &apos;re going to digest us if we were not going to make a shoot pulver for you . 
we decided to redefine health care as a doctor or a mentor . 
it &apos;s a very simple trick , but i always do it when i have a window square . 
and if you think it &apos;s not going to go , it &apos;s going to push it up until you keep going . 
the other thing is , you know , it would be better if you didn &apos;t have to take blood . 
and when that happens , it has to change our understanding of our past , our present and human culture . 
like i leave the water , solly reaches a credible , a canal between us . 
and this is still in work , but dermatologists -- so i &apos;m a pet-tart . 
liver cells , neurons , pancreases -- we can &apos;t grow ourselves today . 
zk : i just want you all to know that this demo of target is going to be supported . 
i had a terrible decision to make , and frankly , it was political dynamite . 
i used to be a bachfan . i played bach on the guitar , you know . 
and where we don &apos;t need it , and we have to stay dark , we can avoid it . 
thank you very much , it &apos;s interesting because through this action , we had to put ourselves together with the companies . 
then a few years later , we green this part of desert using permacultures . 
here we have madd chadd , lil &apos;c , kid david and j smooth . 
it feels like the cell is ready when the chromosomes have taken their position . 
for me , as for millions of other people in the world today , english is a well-designed language . 
and for us , young people , they try to become individuals , and find the differences in each other . 
if you &apos;re really used to this , we &apos;re going to move on with the crows that come back . 
it &apos;s just incredible to see multiple gharial that go on the river . 
it would be immoral to leave these young people to a climate system that &apos;s out of control . 
you have to do these steps . if you do that -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science . 
but it says that what we can do about it is very little , very high cost . 
so we make it the same way , to be part of the ideal interdust , like everyone else . 
in every car accident where at least one person dies , there &apos;s information about everyone . 
charles darwin , and they left the bloodline of chimpanzees about five million years ago . 
workers are treated as well or as poor as the workers were treated that built this chair . &quot; 
and the book left me thinking about this theory , because i have to explain what i mean by that . 
but as soon as they passed , it began to climb up the wall . 
and they said , &quot; well , we don &apos;t know , but there are only rituals that make us meaning . &quot; 
and in fact , the first treatment methods , for humans and dogs , are already available . 
you know , when you do something you love , it feels like an hour like five minutes . 
we are , or should be moral to be the world &apos;s healer . 
and he says that every culture tends to commute between two perspectives . 
what he wanted to say with this is that we &apos;ve collected basically stamps here . 
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we start doing while we are ? &quot; 
so it &apos;s meant to learn something , learn an idea of learning an organism and then apply it . 
i realized that the line is about where the only square building is in the village . 
but if you &apos;re together to plant trees for the environment , that &apos;s okay -- creativity . 
then the next day , i got a collection at the headquarters and a few women came . 
but you &apos;ve noticed that i lied because i went only in 1994 . 
because dna is like a blueprint , you understand , the living thing tells you what to do . 
suppose you have , well , any other sensual organs and whatnot . 
one of the things that i had to learn as a journalist was how to deal with my anger . 
you could buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything because it was silenced . 
you decide . this is your bakery , your street , your country , not meant . &quot; 
so we started breast cancer because there &apos;s a lot of money there , not government money . 
oh . another thing i wanted to point out . look at stickybot . 
and there are two important messages , or two lessons that you can take from reality . 
you see , this insight has potential , you could see it as a regular underwear . 
i thought he &apos;d done the video . so , here we go back . 
and what &apos;s even more important is the force i led was over 20 countries . 
it &apos;s not necessary to stay with me all day to push the wheelchair . &quot; 
and that gives me hope , because it means that people are not entirely selfish . 
the hospice was for people who were dying , but terence was not that far . 
one thing you can do with a picture like this is just admiring it . 
and you may have noticed what we don &apos;t need to know , there is no past in the calculation . 
leaders have a position of power or authority , but those who inspire us . 
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides of this , it was fiction . 
so she went back to korea , to the village of hyun-sook , but she was gone . 
if you don &apos;t want to be reward , you have to know what hungry you are . 
unfortunately , it &apos;s not really a picture . can i please have my drawing block ? thank you , wonderful . 
it &apos;s a holocaust of a different way of ignoring that doesn &apos;t help anyone . 
anyway , today we &apos;re going to talk a little bit about architecture , about creation and optimism . 
and the philistist who was sent down , her powerful warrior , is a giant . 
the first time , nothing will happen because the system has no idea that he thinks &quot; draw . &quot; 
i wanted to know where the kind of learning we &apos;re finding in school today . 
and &quot; ha-ha , there &apos;s a picture , and here i am , and what &apos;s the whole thing to do ? &quot; 
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has deep roots in the cosmos . 
she has a cabinet , an education minister , an energy minister , a health minister . 
and i can &apos;t tell you how difficult it is to make these refrigerators . 
well , i thought i &apos;d have the answer to that question , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot; 
and it &apos;s very hard to be happy to be on a planet that is destroyed by hunger and drought . 
the material that &apos;s being laid out is either in liquid form or a powder . 
so -- -- well , if you think about it , here &apos;s the ham problem . 
there is no real word for the things that make us secure , but don &apos;t make us feel security . 
we quickly realized that beaver could be something that needs the rotluchs . 
so think about these three situations that i told you about : factory , migration , office . 
interestingly , when people get this , they don &apos;t check again , but now they participate . 
they &apos;re actually trying to figure out what people should do instead of driving cars in high traffic time . 
and i think if you look at the animal world , it &apos;s one of the most remarkable things . 
now , this is a little test . i encourage you to try it at a party . 
we think it &apos;s great when students keep it , even if they don &apos;t beat mathematical professionals . 
it &apos;s not when great new tools emerge that they use to penetrate society . 
70 percent of all antibiotics being consumed in the united states are taken over animal care . 
it &apos;s one of the many characteristics that women own who bring them to work lives . 
seriously , these changes that i &apos;ve been in the place , i thought it would have been 12 years . 
but the idea behind it is , like in a newspaper , we show a corresponding phone . 
it &apos;s terrible . it &apos;s evidence of our failures to ensure their survival in the wild . 
well , we collect data : recorded satellites , from airplanes , vehicles , by people . 
if you tell someone who speaks to you , you can &apos;t understand anymore , it &apos;s too loud . 
i have a friend who has a digital blog -- on pdrs , a close-up device . 
i showed this picture here because i often asked if in the project animals . 
you can see here that the little negative trials that should be on the lower left are gone . 
and mark twain , who knew everything about printing , was obsessed with this machine . 
it has these strong , heroic arms that donuts can shrink into their own mouths . 
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth that &apos;s produced in africa is not invested in africa ? 
but i thought , no , no , experiment with hartzen and experimentation with polymers . 
and i think the reason this would be so interesting to you is that consciousness is so interesting . 
they can tweete their weight to their friends , and then they can help them keep their weight . 
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil who invested in the project , and also with the government . 
and he had a very big head , which meant could point out on a water head . 
i started a few companies that i believed were the ticket to the financial freedom . 
now hopefully we can show the audience how it can be that you do what you do . 
and as a result , it &apos;s a very different use of technology and knowledge that they &apos;re surrounded with . 
i just want to tell you that my job is a privilege because we live in a special time . 
my graduate student pranav , who , as i said , is the brilliant head behind this idea . 
i had the ones that could do it , but they didn &apos;t do it , and they did it , but they couldn &apos;t . 
in fact , we have a surprising dancer that &apos;s the last thing i &apos;m going to show you today . 
when i look around , in this talk , amsterdam auditorium , i see a special audience . 
it &apos;s very fashioned to talk about global trade , in this great , climatized space . 
we need to make sure that they &apos;re proud of being farmers , because they allow us to survive . 
if we start to think exponentially , we can understand how this is affecting technologies in our environment . 
and as you can see here , there are groups that are growing above each other because they spread out . 
for them , nations , borders are still a big role , often a violent one . 
sb : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s all 10 years . 
about half of you who are women have made a pregnant test at some point . 
bl : this bacterium that we &apos;ve talked about is the simplest one we know life form . 
it &apos;s going to change people &apos;s perception and opinion that pay for everything , and that &apos;s our hope . 
and finally , the only portrait of a man who painted , &quot; the musician . &quot; 
of course , as soon as you say something like this , people say impossible , and that said suzuki . 
it stays for months and often for years , and if that happens , it &apos;s a disease for its own . 
i can see everything romo sees , and i can get the view of a robot to the world . 
and 1972 , the united states began to launch a counterpart of the sea protected area . 
it has to be cheap , fast , just sensitive and specialty and minimally invasive . 
you can look at these works of art , and of course , the complex social organization of the people they &apos;ve created . 
and then you hear things like the train , on the plane , on the car -- so on the way to work . 
in fact , a translator of technology and developing something that &apos;s so pure , basically pollutants . 
but , what we lose , i think , is just -- a feeling sense of the sky is a kind of context . 
a few things that i &apos;ve made are the poster over here where you can play headstuff . 
i &apos;ve learned that they are the essence of what progress is , even when they appear terrible . 
the first one is that the greatest political value of chinese unity is the truth of chinese civilization . 
this one , a little bit transient , zipping back , looking at the back foot . 
of course , i can . and you enjoy it unmine . i see it standing around -- just everywhere , everywhere . 
for one thing , it was dancing , even though it wasn &apos;t offered , it meant everything . 
and i started to see the world from a whole new perspective of how pairs are connected to each other . 
&quot; look , when she said &quot; good morning , &quot; i recognized her accent of fife . 
you see , the indians also knew a river that separated the land of the dead . 
and we think that these people probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and they &apos;re called barack obama . 
if you do this morning , i will die , you will die , every single one of these men will die . 
tourist : people are very frustrated that they don &apos;t get closer to seeing everything . 
and we &apos;re going to start to influence our health and our intelligence with the more we approach these technologies . 
i think ted , you know , affect the lives of people you may not even realize . 
there &apos;s only 102 , because at some point it &apos;s boring to collect it . every year there &apos;s new . 
and then , this year , the iron minister was discharged and convicted to 10 years . 
secondly , keeping mothers healthy and alive . children stop alive . no longer orphans . 
there are countless ways of connecting us to other people , and it seems to be the same everywhere . 
can you feel your anger , your fear , your anger about what &apos;s going on in your country ? 
as i said , we can cut the channel , we can spread it across the couch . 
we had full-page resources , about 30 , 25 years ago when this channel came . 
our interest is to find beauty that is more than just aesthetic , but actually a truth . 
they put it in google , translated it to italian , came back to italian google . 
another interesting project that needs a little bit of support is the broadband rhinos . 
but let &apos;s bring some light into this amazing , multiplied continent that has so much to offer . 
they may not have a lot of data that they could put in there , but they know to challenge them . 
they &apos;ve met children with a different standard and all that , a different way of thinking , a completely different society . 
we see people who are disparate , &quot; &quot; anectent , &quot; &quot; feeling responsible . 
they could be extinct in less than 10 years unless we do something now to protect them . 
bl : i &apos;m spinning at the moment of the decision , because i don &apos;t know that i have a lot of time . 
because one such mechanism has been found already by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang . 
it &apos;s true that the internet and the new media are very useful to make things faster and cheaper . 
what &apos;s left is this slope , the mortality rate , the more you get to north . 
and even those who believed it was better to tell them exactly the control . exactly the act . 
we went to africa , sudan , to sierra leone , liberia , kenya . 
from the minute a child is taught to play an instrument , it &apos;s not poor anymore . 
and he said , &quot; i hope you &apos;ll have the strength to do what i did . 
never to take care of the rent , i could spend my time doing what i really like . 
and after three minutes in this water , only three minutes in this water , it could restore . 
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; great sister wong , &quot; washburn , wong , jacket like hose . 
that means before we could start digitizing the archimdes , we had to take the book apart . 
i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why we need to work harder . 
the doctors , it seemed , had never really had enough time for all their patients , so much they tried . 
so this is the pattern that every one of you got up , but you were all a little different . 
we get increasingly a diet dominated in the sense of sensory , not the story , dominated . 
i have to admit , it wasn &apos;t what i imagined for my first day , &quot; down under . &quot; 
that &apos;s what i wear every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection . 
another strategy that we &apos;ve been following is the use of decellular organs . 
it &apos;s based on a few thousand people that we sampled in a handful of groups around the world . 
in short , they &apos;re given status they had a million years ago , 10,000 or 100,000 years ago . 
this is an example of how software is now building their own hardware , and this is how we &apos;re imagining biology . 
michael free from path says , it &apos;s about who &apos;s looking at a product and paying . 
what we need to do is demand our lives , our objects , our objects , our circumstances : purpose . 
women are much more balance than that , because they don &apos;t share that view that they can create 100 climains . 
that means that a lot of people are completely unhappy and skeptical when i try to explain consciousness . 
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to make a place online if you work in large amounts . 
we can continue to look for ingredients that we love for hours and talk about our favorite stores for hours . 
just very quickly . make sure that you &apos;re different from each one in 300 . base pair of each other . 
the difficult thing about euopa is that it takes a very long time when 27 people talk at a conference . 
the teachers under us , each one of them has taught that teaching is actually about connections . 
if you take kids with different backgrounds , and that &apos;s what makes special power , then we create a moment . 
this is difficult , so we had to develop the technologies , and we had to basically put ourselves into a body . 
except , it &apos;s not as rich as we have , because they don &apos;t have cerebral cortex like us . 
and we can see the implications of these mutations when we compare dna sequences , for example , in this room . 
they didn &apos;t destroy it ; they just took a new position , and this new position can be as beautiful . 
we &apos;re already wired as if we were in a fiber grain , if you will . 
this man , his name was mahmoud , and his name was rafi . 
and many of you have noticed that this is not such a big result of how you might have liked to have . 
there &apos;s this thing , the militarization of the world , and it &apos;s coming right from the center of the united states . 
the next map is africa &apos;s gdp of 1960 , about the time that many african states have been independent . 
and she saw that if there was no inflammation , the scan was actually gray . 
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the soviet union during the time . 
if you look like this , you look into the past or within yourself when you &apos;re very moving . 
and if you do that , the origami has the same size , but our square at the end is three times the size . 
but there are countries like guatemala , papua new guinea , yemen and afghanistan . 
the ham himself , the animal -- no cat , no dog , a horror -- why a nose ? 
you see , these corals can be really mean . i have scars of the surf that prove this . 
books have rescued introverts , shattering kid that i was once -- that i was . 
but i still had doubt , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; 
the good side is , i think , a kind of fundamental idea that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting . 
we don &apos;t want people to look at our movies and say , &quot; that was funny , &quot; and then forget them again . 
and i &apos;d like to say that she &apos;s also the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , therefore ... 
the costs were enormous -- water pollution , all the things that you know , destruction of our habitats . 
and then this is what , then a young man named willy bohm who worked for usaid . 
the human shape , especially human head , is considered a holy grail of the movie industry . 
well , on september 4th , there was a big predator , which is what you do in polio . 
and if anyone asks why you have a condom , you can just say , you like design . 
i know most of you have had the experience of coming home and playing games like this . 
first of all , most of you are born in the &apos; 80s and &apos; 90s , under the one-child policy . 
finding our own solutions to solving problems like corruption , to build institutions that stabilize micro-economics . 
it grew up in my head , and then it &apos;s related to the whole process that i grew through . 
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick . 
it &apos;s just bringing together things that have been done before , just put together in a different way . 
so they said that i &apos;d let this machine speak only in english , so we had to learn english . 
elon musk , i wish we had all day , thank you for coming to ted . 
this is great , which means , soon , there are 10 billion heads working together , 10 billion talents combined . 
we love challenges , but if expectations are low , believe me , we will only fulfill them . 
the kids just take pictures in a class they get them , they put them on the school walls . 
this is probably the saddest sound i &apos;ve ever heard of an organism , human , or other nature . 
you can recline , and then the camera changes its perspective , depending on which direction you &apos;re looking . 
by the way , the secret is not to bed , before you put together your words for this day . 
we already have the data that shows that it takes the duration of its flu a few hours . 
i loved making the book because i loved to play my imagination , and this is writing . 
and that allows me to look at discrete at the clock , without hitting the arm . 
they have 22 satellites flicking around an altitude of about 100 miles , and the site is red . 
it &apos;s very simple to fall into the decentralized , from down to top structure of the internet . 
not because it claimed earlier , i take it because i did a little calculation . 
and there , and only there , you can really feel part of a larger thing , or a larger ecosystem . 
so , practices compassion , read the script , spreads it , and develops it in you . 
now , of course , at this age , i couldn &apos;t express it like this , but i told her , i feel fine in the square . 
and i realized that i had come to something that was huge potential to change the world . 
people who hear color color color color actually , when they perceive the sound of words or letters . 
most of the cars i drive are starting to rats when i get 80 miles an hour . 
i still do all the videos , but we have a brilliant team that &apos;s taking care of the software . 
i have to mention that before i got to the united states , i had never identified as an african . 
people who need a voice should know that most computers have already had language technology built . 
it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s mountain bike or reading a book or playing a game . 
and then i think the other thing is that indians are largely more agreed with globalization . 
now , fashion designers have the widest palette that you can imagine in the business of creativity . 
i &apos;m going to go around and encourage you , &quot; go , go ! &quot; you &apos;ve got to write like crazy or two hours . 
we also believe that individual can make a difference , and also because individual together can help a movement . 
maybe you , maybe i -- but we &apos;re not here to act with opinions , everybody has an opinion . 
now i thought , if you do good science , it changes medical treatment , but it was a little naive . 
silk . make a product that doesn &apos;t have to be cooled next to the milk shelf . 
i shouldn &apos;t walk the gang and say , &quot; hi , jack ! &quot; i know that &apos;s not cool . 
and so , on the micro-level , there is a role for this combination of investment and philanthropy . 
i think normally when companies get bigger , they find it very difficult to go even small , innovative projects . 
i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , at the end , is the wrong question is that this is not the major question . 
so every time you &apos;ve found something that looked a little different , that would give that another name . 
this is a mouse that was captured by charles vacanti at the university of massachusetts . 
just look at google here map . there &apos;s 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 . 
it converted the music industry , it has changed the way we consume music . 
and you can interact with your neighbors , with people you like , with people you might not know . 
but the way people tell stories has always evolved with pure , constant neugence . 
from which we talked about , my friends in brazil , how we can scale the model in china and brazil . 
and i want to conclude with the question of you , which will be the next story , where this object will emerge . 
and i &apos;m going to show you one last demonstration , but first i want to thank you , and i &apos;m always thinking very small . 
again , it &apos;s completely interactive , you can rotate it and look at things in real time at these systems . 
this is the challenge . ok , so let &apos;s look at the journey of the wheat and look at these 12 states . 
for the first time , i wanted to meet people , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and even see how they lived . 
meanwhile , i was playing around with my tape , the dresden dollar , in nachtclub . 
so , and this song is about how eleventual everybody is , you know , we come from russia . 
and this is one thing that teaches their piano teachers to them , but there was never a science about these things . 
what i mean by this is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technologies . 
and what we see here is the rise of gases methane , ch4 , the atmosphere of mars . 
a culture that is controlled from the top , where millions are lost . 
finally , she says , &quot; mom , do you think there are people on the internet who are couples ? &quot; 
and i think this has been the fundamental problem of the last 50 years that we wanted to understand what cancer is . 
car-sharing services are now emerging all over the world , and these efforts are , i think , great . 
but with structures that combine instead of separate , circles that depend on each other rather than isolating triangles . 
and the latest number that i &apos;m working on -- is true -- i don &apos;t know what it is . 
he knows a world , and finds a way to communicate this to another world , because he has both deep connections . 
so what did we do ? i met nice people , like they invited us into the hamptons . 
because transistors are getting smaller and smaller , increasingly , we see they &apos;re not going to act like that . 
today , i &apos;m going to tell you two things : first of all , what we &apos;ve lost , and two , how we regain it . 
if we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my concerns is that there are so many organizations today . 
the women are coming because of the treatment , but we know , a test and the giving of a drug is not enough . 
you can look at the patients , you can go through all the controls . you can look at them , you can ask them . 
and we do something different than what we &apos;ve done in the past , and we put a minimum of intelligence there . 
in fact , even in the ancient , the solar system was sort of like this diagram . 
she couldn &apos;t reach me . she &apos;s now saying she doesn &apos;t want to get me . because i &apos;m a godless person . 
and it &apos;s too cerebral to animate courage and hearts and behavior , turning hard up . 
the printer you see here has printed this kidney structure that i showed you earlier . 
so what we did in the united states is we tested the data , end up testing the data . 
just that little bit of money i wish i had on my bank account -- unfortunately not , but ... 
and yet , although for john everything was fine , he had problems , he was struggling with dependence and severe depression . 
basically , it &apos;s a song about veil , but not the kind of loop that i &apos;m making here . 
although it &apos;s true , you know , the reason i speak to you is because i was born in brazil . 
this was bruno bowden , which is also here . world record . em : heart happiness wish . 
what you see in black lines here is the safe space , the quantified boundaries , preposed by this analysis . 
now , another scientist , when he or she makes a discovery , usually no idea what kind of applications could come out of it . 
that sounds good , but deep inside you do know that &apos;s not the whole truth , and i also say why . 
you know these cells , because they &apos;re the ones that they frustrate when they try to bleed a fly . 
especially , it focuses on japan , korea and australia , countries that are close allies in the united states . 
so it started working with the work that i did in ireland , where i was teaching , and it spread silther . 
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my great pleasure to share two examples with you . 
in fact , in the united states , there are 350 units in the world teaching courses about video games . 
&quot; i &apos;m going to find the way to get there , because i don &apos;t want this story to disappear . &quot; 
the other part of the good news , at least for the scientists , is that there &apos;s lots of things left to be discovered . 
there are many things that can predict my approach to it , and some of the things that it doesn &apos;t do . 
why not ? it &apos;s possible . look around here -- all this knowledge , this energy , this talent and technology . 
so we thought we &apos;d use this idea to see if we could predict phenomena in networks . 
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s october 10 , and i said , &quot; what ? &quot; 
if you actually look at the register , you &apos;ll see that many of the people in the e.u. signed things . 
i realized at the time that i wanted to take a journey to see what men are creating for themselves today . 
i think the concept of a global citizenship is just going to come up with people talking across continents across the continent . 
and our entire body , everything -- the hair , skin , bone , nails -- everything is made of collagen . 
and so one of the tools that we explored the ocean was the acoustics , so sound waves . 
as bill mcdonough realized , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences . 
and this man , archie cochrane , is a prisoner and a doctor , and he has a problem . 
and those galaxies that have much less dark energy collapse into themselves are not forming galaxies . 
it &apos;s not about buying 100,000 or 1,000 . i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would actually be better . 
one person interacting with the robot grabs where it &apos;s going to reach and is not surprised by its movements . 
the kindness and kindness in her face immediately took me for her , and i asked her to tell me her story . 
this is not a fiction , not a fairy tale , not a fantasy ; it &apos;s insensitive , sharp science . 
i &apos;m going to show you a computer model of iain couzin , a researcher in oxford , which shows how swarms work . 
this is a device that not only measures the heart rhythm , as you &apos;ve seen , it can still be much more . 
this happened in different opportunities , but i think it was a huge advantage to be a woman . 
we paid them 10 cents a real question , 50 cents , one dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per real question . 
i &apos;m going to discuss some of the problems that are there , and some of the problems that we &apos;re working on for solutions . 
so , there &apos;s more and more activity next to the boat , and suddenly someone calls , &quot; what &apos;s this in the water ? &quot; 
we show a manifestation of something that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a part of our identity , but nobody can own . 
so finally , we have to ask a lot of questions , and as i said , we &apos;re going to ask questions here , not answer . 
we &apos;ve done a survey that confirms 45 percent of people in a major demographic group in the u.s . 
and later , about 100,000 to 50,000 years ago , they left africa to colonize the rest of the world . 
and then , what would a population make a balance that could continue by 2050 , 2100 ? 
more like a phenomenon of work , theroetic physicists are always interested , &quot; why &quot; it &quot; works , &quot; how it works . 
i tried to ask anyone i could to ask for who , against what runners , so who am i staying here ? 
and then , because the juveniles are in my collection , i looked at them and looked at the inside . 
what suggests that even if you lose the hearing , the ability of the brain to process music . 
and mothers grabbed after their children , so they wipe me out , and they say , &quot; don &apos;t go staring ! &quot; 
and i think , when we look at culture , we get to some kind of understanding of how we became the way we are . 
our inability to acknowledge and encourage people to raise money , to say , &quot; sit down . &quot; 
a wise person knows how to improvise , how luke did it when he knew the floor twice . 
in this case , it &apos;s because they &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;m going to use to tell you about , prints of monet &apos;s images . 
so , these are the footage that he had filmed , and they were very moving and terrifying . 
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear whether we humans have control over it . 
but i also learned quickly that jesus said , and i write that always being poor among us . 
they &apos;re not running 42 kilometers , but 150 miles a piece of paper , and apparently without injuries , without problems . 
it doesn &apos;t always work out of self-interest , because when feelings come into play , the ties change how it works . 
you have to pay for your soap , your deo , your toothbrush , your toothpaste -- for everything . 
and the second one is about a new dimension that i want to talk about , which has never been in the form of today . 
you know , what i love is , for example , if you look at the biggest eye there , there are so many houses in there . 
now , when you see the first time , you ask yourself , &quot; oh my god . how can it come out of reality ? &quot; 
like saddam , like muting , like kim jug il , machthbut killing thousands or millions . 
and i realized something else , which is that , on a bad day , it &apos;s extremely difficult to record that one second . 
so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i had to be proud to be part of this story . 
i used to think that my early days at the bowery poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was a lot earlier . 
what it might mean , this moment , for cultural movements everywhere , the &quot; me , &quot; we seem incredibly important . 
unfortunately , it was the last one she said to him . she never saw him again . he didn &apos;t survive . 
so the final thing i &apos;d like to say is that we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have . 
but we should ask the question , whether we &apos;re seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and the way we &apos;re processing data . 
this is &quot; 6,500 yards , &quot; &quot; after carot . &apos; 9,000 yards , &quot; after gerhard judge . 
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and a state in the middle . 
you see , it was like , if you wanted to take a song , you needed a studio and a manufacturer . 
sorghoes are testing , again , testing design . we &apos;re going to gain new insights , complexity and difficult things . 
it had something to do with being raised in a family where no one was speaking english , no one could read english or write . 
there &apos;s the side that &apos;s fighting and there &apos;s a side that holds schools and factories and hospitals open . 
it &apos;s beautiful . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge copyright violation , but it &apos;s pretty rocketing . 
so , the contribution of culture , if culture impacts us what it does , it changes us by changing our brains . 
this is a version of 20 men getting to jupiter : kojen , shelter , practicing room . 
a victim in thousands of competitions , three big civil rights laws , health insurance for older , education support . 
now , being ready means that we can do things if the things we take for granted are not available . 
since then , for eight years , i &apos;ve been so much saying that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a lawyer . 
i mean , it would be an advantage to experience our emotions inside , you know , anger or happiness . 
this is all recognized . and this is the melody , which is at the most frequent time in the world . 
but i love to explore all the possibilities in hoping that you are on the same wavelength as your audience is . 
and then god looked into the future , and he realized that if the world was only created with justice , it could not exist . 
other examples that you can see here are from littland , purple , estonia -- the central european countries . 
so let &apos;s move in less than three minutes , from the beginning to the end , observing , and teach a few lessons from it . 
i &apos;m addicted , because i think i know that i refer to reality , but i want to do more and more . 
i mean , how has a device built for printing and artillery in a medium ? 
particle masses , the strength of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by these extra dimensions . 
so if we wanted to design a perfect cochlear implant , we would try to get it to transmit music . 
we live under these men : they are our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us . 
so , i was a little scared , because if you see these three problems , they seem to be really hard to fight them . 
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . the warm prizes increase , it affects inflation . 
he proved that she was a prime number with nothing but a feather , ink , paper and intellect . 
by the german , checked edges of these clouds , they &apos;re ideal to detect figures in it . 
and if you &apos;re a leader , then the people who rely on you are on the legs . 
they needed millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of the developing world to cover the need . 
many people thought it was just impossible to do an aids vaccine , but today india is speaking a different language . 
it &apos;s about solving problems , and there &apos;s this great , beautiful thing between design , economic life and the world . 
this will all be much more violent than having a single ship , in a place , to go to a different place . 
when i thought about this , i realized that all of these attributes have to be changed so that t can get into the denominator . 
and i don &apos;t want to stop you with details , but in the lower right corner , you &apos;ll see an example of what we have for it . 
these two missions fit , as you can see , perfect together , one pedestries the other . in fact , they weren &apos;t possible without each other . 
enormous . but this should have a footnote , which is that two-thirds of the workers in the world are exposed to it . 
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t you believe that man has the responsibility to make the world a little bit better for the next generation ? 
unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it has severe , profound , if you will , impact on her family . 
there are rich and poor black and white lesters , not many female lesters , but let &apos;s do that first . 
they land on the flower , they put their tongue in there , they also know , and then they drink the sugar water . 
the spaces are smaller , with less hall , so he can write pretty intricate music that &apos;s very complex -- and it works . 
she came down , and she saw this great house , and she said , &quot; you know what , it &apos;s terrible what you &apos;re doing to these guys . 
he was the souvenirman who always wanted to be a painter , and i was frankie p.toronto . 
a thousand feet tall animal with beautiful skulls , a predator , a carnivorous carnivore . 
we &apos;ve all learned what can happen for a panic when an old disease comes back , like milzfire fire . 
and i know things , of course , as designers , about typography , even though we haven &apos;t worked very well with these animals . 
and with billions of the future we &apos;re always hearing about , this world is just too complex to just understand it like this . 
what &apos;s green here is not desertification , which is called braun , hidden . these are the largest areas of the earth . 
one of the founders was in switzerland , and she saw it somewhere in use , and she said , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really great . 
we had a speaker here who said exactly that , and a sword came back , and it was quite dramatic . 
what you see in this diagram of toughness , the further the black dot on the diagram , the brightest . 
in other words , when someone touches me , my hand fires a neuron in the sensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain . 
yet , there &apos;s a big problem with movement , which is that it &apos;s difficult to orient itself in the air .

often , we hope that anything is evolving like we wish it , but we don &apos;t need to do it to make these wishes come true . 
but i think that privacy can be protected , and if i just look at your car right now , at that moment , from the outside , i don &apos;t know anything about you . 
you &apos;ll find it as free download . thank you craig mundie . you &apos;ll find it on the worldvital telescope.org website that &apos;s something new . 
we thought of an application with the tablet , and let me show you what we could simulate , what we could do , every one of us in a museum . 
studies of the scanning structure that might demand new materials : so that you can know some light through it , light through it , not accessible . 
because , when this happens , i think we can feel free to be more honest , more just and more creative to act with each other and help each other . 
and then when we start to define the meaning of &quot; steep , &quot; we realize that it would be nice to own some corners to really boundary what it means . 
it &apos;s part of our human dna , and maybe it &apos;s time that our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance societies , we start counting on the power of hope . 
a world graphics center -- you can imagine news , messages , messages , sounds , images that are being provided at every point in the world , immediately and wireless . 
and that combination , this cumulative technology , i &apos;m fascinated with , because i think there &apos;s a secret in it if you want to understand what is going on in the world . 
why ? because we know what they have , and we know how to treat it , even though we can &apos;t make a vaccine , but that &apos;s a different story . 
now , i &apos;m not going to explain the physical part , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet is going to fall , the bigger the braking force is higher . 
that means that if you have t.b. , the probability of not being diagnosed is greater , but you die of secondary infections of t.b. and so on . 
another unique feature of bats is that they can use sound waves to detect their environment . they use echolocation . 
if you go like this , that &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can go , but maybe you can &apos;t see if you &apos;re going to go with your eyes , oh , there &apos;s a hole . 
but it didn &apos;t happen what you might think , that he suddenly became passionate , engaged a new teacher in puberty , or whatever . 
it &apos;s just too boring whether you &apos;re feeling like this or something , and by the way , the more you &apos;re focusing on how you feel , the worse it gets . 
and it never makes you feel like you &apos;re walking down a road , and it &apos;s just because you &apos;re walking on one side or the other side of your road , changing your life forever . 
and the challenge for algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is they &apos;re surrounding this balance because they &apos;re all about what they &apos;re doing first . 
later , i got scared of heart attacks when i was a kidney in treatment , and all of a sudden they say , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot; 
we &apos;re going to dive into the deep sea today , and anyone who has done this already knows that after about two and a half hours , it &apos;s gone down to stockduster . 
in fact , the fact that it can &apos;t change anything from art to a neutral place for exchange and discussions , and gives you a change in the world . 
and , you know , we can look back today and say , of course , ha , is all microfilm . but that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future . 
but much more to keep advice , to give her comments , to spread the customers that if it &apos;s possible in the air , it &apos;s possible , of course , on the ground . 
but i also think there is a climate crisis that is also serious about the same root that we need to address with the same urgency . 
so what i &apos;m looking at is really saying that for a very long time , we &apos;ve had a situation where we &apos;ve had a number of choices . 
it was kind of burned slowly , but it was rose , compared to other rocket pollutants that i had tried all the sulfur . 
if you &apos;ve ever seen an image of a scanning electron microscope , you can see this . it looks the same , it &apos;s this part over here that &apos;s so incredibly complicated . 
now , i &apos;ve learned that my place is not only in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still looking for my identity , but i &apos;ve seen ghana better design democracy . 
so , what people told me about the cause of cancer that was the causes of cancer , or why you are who you are didn &apos;t make sense of it . 
in a region that &apos;s famous for her soft , porous holes , lived until recently about 40 million people in these underground houses . 
and what they &apos;ve discovered is that the use of violence in these situations is not just less human , but also less effective than the use of the methods that people rebuild . 
you might think it &apos;s just good karma , if these men fail , but it &apos;s also economically powerful because they save a billion dollars every year . 
he &apos;s totally noisy . there are little kids flying around on his leg , little spirits , and we need to correct this stuff , fast , ladies and gentlemen . 
and their stories were so full of horror , and so overwhelming , and so on the other side of human being , that i was , frankly , destroyed on the ground . 
just like that , we can regain our freedom , and only that means that the energy and the passion are free so that we can master the challenges of our time . thank you very much . 
at the time when i interviewed the red brigades , i also discovered that their lives were not defined by ideology and politics , but by economic forces . 
in the netherlands , where i come from , you &apos;ll see as good as never pigs , which is strange because we have 12 million people living in a population of 16 million people . 
the most important discovery that we made with our focus on public action was that the difficult decisions are not between good and evil , but between rivalalizing good decisions . 
the dystopie worries me is a universe where a few geniuses invent things like google and the rest of us are paid to mask them . 
i remember -- natasha didn &apos;t want us to open the door -- i didn &apos;t try to open the door because we needed as long as we had to boil us up . 
but the odd thing about this is that google lies , because if you type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; google says , &quot; and it &apos;s not necessary . we automatically do this . &quot; 
through this cosmic assumption that we are all alone , each of us , and every other is different from us , we got into a impossible situation , right ? 
and i want you to think of yourself as chinese woman who receives a chinese flag because her beloved has died in america during the coal insurgency . 
but i think if you look at what &apos;s behind these things , you get to what &apos;s probably the real reason , the core of the question , which is how we think about time . 
and the sad thing about this story was that , as soon as your parents drove from it , and didn &apos;t forget , their parents brought her to the doctor , they were put her parents on the street . 
the person on the fly band doesn &apos;t know , because it doesn &apos;t know how to go after an oil source to extract the oil from the plastic and so on . 
he liked to make his students practice , and they should take a piece of paper and draw the person next to them , their neighbors , very quickly , as they could . 
suddenly , symptoms disappeared to return -- because no feeling for the other half is , for pleasure , to feel happiness , to feel gratitude , the positive emotion . 
you , you yourself , will find yourself in a hotel bed -- or your mother , your child -- some nicken , people will say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot; 
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t just come and wait , but then the professionals , when they finally were there , they had to call somebody for the third time . 
the next poem is based on him how he &apos;s trying to tell me a little bit about the domestic labels on the land , and in the beginning , i had difficulty understanding them . 
i think you can look at the way we look at pictures , really enrich and make this kind of shoe carton , with photos of your family on the kitchen table and so on . 
you know , sometimes you can give all the facts and numbers , and he says , &quot; i know what all facts and details are saying , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot; 
jim collins , the author of &quot; the way to the best , &quot; told me that successful organizations of all kinds have two things together : they maintain the core , they promote progress . 
today , we only use one raw material , petroleum , to heat our homes , to drive our cars and to make most of the materials that you see around you . 
the acoustic director gave us criteria criteria that led to this enemy treasury , which , as we did after the competition , would not work . 
anybody here once asked , what happens when you go back to your room at night , and suddenly you get hurt in the breast , shorthability , swiss breaks ? 
he wrote this to his love , mouth gonna , and he regretted that he couldn &apos;t give her that he thought she was clouding him . 
i think it &apos;s very important because right now someone needs to stand up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that when they get the chance to do it . 
and when i was doing this , i realized that at one of the great ted talks of the past , nathan , we talked about an active tail . 
world population , pc platerungen , the archive of all medical literature , moore &apos;s law , the old way of sequencing , and here are all kinds of new things . 
that &apos;s what happened to me when i realized that we &apos;re moving away from passive consumers to places , to highly active collaborators . 
so , we &apos;ll fly to mars one day , and if we do that , it will be unfair to the people who live there with such ridiculous names . 
so despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s supermassive , and i &apos;m about to get to what that really means , it doesn &apos;t have a finite size . 
but there &apos;s a lot of people out there telling you that they have super-sense , magical forces , that they predict the future that they make contact with the dead . 
the phrase that you say as a ph.d , postdoc or professor , when 38-year-old economic professor , is , &quot; i am empirics . 
and the oceans are so productive , it happens so much for human beings that we need to make , even from a selfish perspective , better than we have to do so far . 
you can see the lidonard proving that &apos;s going through here , which is tribeca today , and the beaches of battery park are going up to the 42road . 
and the species in the soil are doing the work , chewing the roots well , crushing them -- the rainworms , mushrooms , bacteria -- and the result is new soil . 
of course , you think of pictures that can be sensory patterns , visually , as you have now , in relation to the stage and me , or auditive images that you have in my words . 
i &apos;m fascinated by the idea of what happens when you mix biology with technology , and i was reading about the idea of being able to program biology in the future , suffering and aging . 
these projects are like this -- paypal , solarcity , tesla , spacex , they &apos;re so spectacular differently , these are such ambitious projects , measured with others . 
she wrote me back and said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son who developed a software that allowed these kids to make their mother &apos;s day cards . &quot; 
i &apos;ve also worked in other parts of new zealand , beautiful , fragilen , protected areas , for example , in fiordland , where i found this colony of sea feathers . 
and so simply , i turned myself from a woman who had been taught to look at these kids as &quot; disabled &quot; in somebody who had a potential that their bodies had not had . 
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , the single eye you see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me explain to you at this point . 
in india , in the first year of life , between zero and one , girls and boys are about the same proportion , because they don &apos;t get the chest , and breast sons don &apos;t prefer . 
they &apos;re building a telescope in the sky , making a picture , figuring out what stars are , and solving these , looking at galaxies , estimate how far they are , and tag it . 
all i can do is hope not to decide and politicians , because that &apos;s how i would love to believe that they read and do something , i don &apos;t deceive myself . 
if i could reveal something hidden to us , at least in modern cultures , it would be something we forgot that we knew earlier , as we know our own name . 
one of the key reasons why it &apos;s so difficult to talk about the problem , and generally , i think , is why it has been unacceptable to talk about it . 
were we all a result of the things that we were attacked , things that were done for us , the unloyalty of a parent or a shadow , saving money ? 
i was expecting , &quot; from here , the lagoon , or somewhere from africa . &quot; but they &apos;re going to be happy , and he said he came from here , from the north sea . 
and sometimes we need a -- a call , not true , to show us that we rapidly live through life rather than living it , that we live fast instead of living well . 
and according to jesus , you have to love yourself , you have to love the gentlemen , your god , with your whole heart , your mind and soul , and your neighbors like yourself . 
as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- you have to inspire you to do more work than ever before in your life , under conditions you can &apos;t imagine . 
and then the broader ideas of urban development start to have direct effects on architecture , on the elements that form the broader sound , the buildings themselves , and guide us . 
every time it comes to the center , it stays , carefully examines the interface of the scaffold , as if it would sniff out the environment , and then it turns around . 
but it was pretty obvious , pretty clear that for this particular track that i had elected , the further the school removed , the results of being worse . 
it was in a sense , in mcluhan &apos;s sense , an external mastomach , in the sense that it was cook that we couldn &apos;t eat otherwise . 
we want to build technological artifacts that could be used for the world . we want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like humans , whales and trees . 
i think politicians can help nurturing non-zero-sum relationships , you know , economic engagement is usually better than blockages and so on , in this regard , i think . 
and within jewish lessons , so in the rabbinical lessons , we have help lel saying that you shouldn &apos;t do anything else you don &apos;t want to do . 
i saw incredible places like mongolia , cambodia , new guinea , south africa , two times tanzania ; i was here one month ago . 
and i think the reason it has in itself is that thousands of years of history doesn &apos;t turn around without much pain , and so i talk about all of us going together . 
and if you lose from your eyes , where you &apos;re in your biosphere , or you &apos;re not aware of the link between you and the biosphere , i &apos;m proposing you very much . 
even with computers that are getting faster and better , it &apos;s a challenge with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data , and to work out the relevant information . 
and in the courtyard , i realized that they had a fountain , because they believe that people were going to a museum make a fountain . 
they don &apos;t get any regular income , but they have the ability to find more tasks , and they learn how to negotiate the ability of negotiating , and they also learn the ability to find more opportunities . 
and these scholars , or these champions , these spiritual masters of sufi tradition , relate to lessons and examples of our prophets teaching us where the source of our problems are . 
we remove what &apos;s not plastic , like metals they &apos;ve missed , carpet , trumber , rubber , wood , glass , paper , anything . 
the culture that we &apos;re living now is flooded with improvisation music that is cut , mixed with each other , and , you know , the mind , distributed and sold . 
then monarchy encouraged her big challenges , the mass democracy , which is considered a good commons , but has been looked at failing experiment , just as capitalism has driven socialism . 
despite television sometimes , about seven to eight percent of the time , in the flow state , but that happens when you choose a show you really want to see , and get your feedback . 
or the comment page , where , if you knew the editor , with him in school , had slept with his wife , could write an article for the comments page . 
you need some water , you have the nanotubes in there , and the antibodies , and you mix the whole thing , you take some paper , you dipped it in and you dry it , and you can already detect cancer . 
but the key here , the reason these groups can connect together is because their work belongs to the work that can be easily digital divided -- an image , a music file , software . 
it may be like having been struggling with multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get healthy . you could die . but if you &apos;re only suffering from one disease , the state of improving . 
when we got there , we just went to the street , we started talking to people everywhere , and we realized that the things were a little different than the phrases we heard in the media . 
it &apos;s really good controllable . there &apos;s a portable remote control that you can accelerate with , break , transition to reverse heat , also with breeding function . 
so i want you to imagine a world where we have better air quality , where the quality of life is better and the quality of life for all of us is better for our future generations . 
complexity is the problem that every theory in biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by posting a power that is even more complex , and just ridiculed the problem . 
and finally , i want to convince you that it &apos;s possible to make this feel backwards , and that if you can , it &apos;s the greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap that you can do . 
so one of our passions in our company is to , and now one of my personal passions is to work really hard to make technologies useful , accessible and affordable . 
and after that , most people actually didn &apos;t come back because it worked , but occasionally , there was a patient who still thought he was sick , and he came back . and my father had a pot . 
anyway , whatever you want , voluntary , try to change your life . globally , there are communities in america and japan -- incredible , right ? imagine america , japan and new zealand . 
i &apos;m also surprised as well , because when i look back at my life , the last thing i ever wanted to do was write about religion , or being involved in any form of religion . 
and there &apos;s something else about those traits that we &apos;re looking at each other that i think should consider consider consider , in fact , that they &apos;re only on the surface of our bodies . 
the trade , on the other hand , is relatively quickly , totally creative , highly effective and efficient , and frankly , because we can &apos;t dive our values long term if we don &apos;t trust each other . 
so &quot; release searches , &quot; here . you can &apos;t see it so well , but we decided we &apos;ll put this function in our adsense , and it &apos;s called &quot; related searches . &quot; 
but it turns out that , as you can see aids skills and behaviors , people with desire to do something very remarkable , and nature is pretty adaptive . 
so here we have three building blocks to try and understand the other , which is china , the civilization-state , the concept of ethnicity , and the kind of state and its relationship to society . 
you know , when a school bus is blown into the air , and we &apos;ve never seen it before , we tend to focus on the new and the new one &apos;s going to be directed . 
the only thing we have that really distinguishes us from chimpanzees and other organisms is our sophisticated language -- a language that we can tell kids of things that we don &apos;t have right in front of . 
now , while we first announced the internet as the amazing new marketing instrument that would solve all of our problems , we realize the internet is this in terms of , if something is effective at all . 
the first &quot; embrace &quot; is something that we think , &quot; oh , it &apos;s very simple , &quot; but it &apos;s actually going to be more difficult and that &apos;s to pay the world around us . 
by studying children &apos;s brains , we &apos;re going to collect basic insights about what it means to be a human , and while we do that , we can perhaps open our own minds to learn for life . 
just remember , what other business you know , what other sector of economics , and especially one that &apos;s as big as the public sector , who doesn &apos;t try to optimize his business model regularly ? 
you realize that especially creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thinkers -- that most people need long periods of interruptions to create something . 
i &apos;m thrilled to meet people like wother , chefs , programmers and taxiers , people i never suspect they love this music and pass it on . 
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculations for this link , down to the right that &apos;s related to coumarin , but an extra fifth of the molecule contains . 
so , if you live in the best climate , in san diego , in the united states or in the worst climate , in buffalo , new york , you &apos;ll be happy in both places . 
well , you can say hotmail wasn &apos;t a miracle , but for me it was one because i was fighting my problem , i used to work in sub-saharan africa . 
she was a woman who was going alone to go to a country whose language couldn &apos;t even speak to a bus and a boat to go to a beach she didn &apos;t know or had never seen . 
you know , i play concerts with this rock , and i &apos;m on the stage , very quiet , you know , just focusing on it . and , you know , what does it do ? what it does ? &quot; you know . 
and as you &apos;ll see in simulation , when you interact , you gain points , you grow , and if you double your size , you &apos;ll see that you &apos;re sharing and you &apos;re producing yourself and growing the population . 
and when i created these dark clouds , and i found it very , very difficult to think of anything good at all , i said that i really have to find a way to focus on something positive . 
and i have to say , before i go on , i ask each one of you to try and take a pen and pieces out of it because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me throw a look at how we do it . 
see , the problem is that obesity and nutritional diseases are not just people who have it , no , injured their friends , brothers and sisters . 
now , this is understandable , but our experience values with met show that a lot of teachers who are leading the process of taking the videos in their classrooms and selecting the teaching hours themselves to participate in the project . 
and recently , i was on the easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful and mysterious place , because no matter where you &apos;re going to the easter island , you &apos;re hitting these statues , moai . 
you literally say , &quot; hey , that &apos;s nice , but -- &quot; like the curve above the focus , many teachers said , &quot; i feel the many kids jumping back and forth and don &apos;t focus on a subject . &quot; 
and we had to be sure that brads would remain in the process , his special corners and enemies that make him who he was , in the process , so that they would seem to be in the digital benjamin . 
so we go &quot; sit , &quot; on the couch , &quot; sit , &quot; also argue , &quot; sit , &quot; look , i &apos;ll advertise a tennis ball , &quot; sit , greet the other dog . 
they bring the water , they bring the soap , i wash the clothes for them , calculate 50 paisa , a rubtary to them , the store , and this is how a new business model can come . 
i mean , think about this : the care that we &apos;re looking at sunglasses or smuck or accessoires is really important , so if it &apos;s not beautiful , it doesn &apos;t belong in your face . 
strangeness determines the contrary of distance and distance that makes me find the people i need right now , the measure of familiarity , of discovery and inspiration that i need in this particular moment . 
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew exactly like i had a choice , and i could continue , or i could let go and not just accept my body , but also accept my living environment . 
and it &apos;s very , very prevalent for designers and humans in visual art to think that we don &apos;t have enough to contribute , or worse , that all we do is fill the landfill . 
planning and service provides the ministry of the support of the population , which is always used : churches , aid organizations , local organizations , local structures , whatever , main thing it works . 
well , he also saw that , as soon as health care intervened in trouble , because of a serious illness , the main reason that keeps us back , is access to information . 
it &apos;s known that the way we know , generalize and use , is affected by our social and istitutional context that has taught us in communism ? 
they &apos;re struggling to develop their own way of life in this forest , in a world that is still clean , a world that is not yet searching , in a world that hasn &apos;t been polluted . 
but if i say that both of them are an example of an alternative or new currency form , in a hyper-connected , fiber driven , global economy , you might think i &apos;m spider . 
they go down to the lobby , they go through the lobby with all the little things that are hanging down there , whether they like it or not , the staircase goes up into the auditorium . 
safely , it &apos;s involved in positive emotion like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in a bunch of other favorites , like memory , language , attention , even annoying , disgust and pain . 
so one way to see if we can explain some of the behavioral change in terms of difference in life expectancy , is to see if malaria is less common , more behavior change . 
and then he didn &apos;t like school so special , but he was involved in a robotic competition , and he recognized the talent , and , much more importantly , it was a real passion for him . 
this is a graph of more than 43 people who couldn &apos;t control the robot , helped stay on the way to reach the opposite side of washington square parks . 
we as individuals who live in the digital now and spend a big part of our weak moments in front of the challenge , in these two streams of time that flow parallel and nearly simultaneously . 
i tried to understand this language as a beginning , as a point where you can go from , and it was built so much of specularies , and it was so much trivialized that it was ... 
with haiti , rewired , with design change , architecture for humanity , aids , it is possible to reach 30,000 , 40,000 masons across the country and start a movement for the right building . 
it &apos;s the results of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neurobiologists , neurosurgeons , different engineers that have come together with what would have been impossible for individuals . 
and i &apos;m going to get you to do something , maybe mathematically , i &apos;m going to get you to understand what symmetry is -- and i &apos;m going to get you to understand this language that allows us to grasp what symmetry is . 
and if we have only enough of these people , then we want more fantasy artists to map places where we &apos;ve never been before , or characters we &apos;ve never seen before . 
you know , what you have to do is be done , even though it &apos;s hard to be , and the feeling of time goes away , you get yourself , you feel like part of something bigger . 
is it the impact ? we have professors from mit , from berkeley , stanford , from the indian science institute that come and teach our kids a lot of scientific formals , experiments that go way beyond normal education . 
but i want to try and make it a little different , which is by trying to close the circle with some personal stories , and by doing so , i can perhaps make a lot of the topics we &apos;ve talked about earlier , a little bit more acoustic . 
there &apos;s the real value that says , when you produce something in a factory and deliver a service , and then there &apos;s some sort of double-stick value that you create when you change the way people see things . 
and we were grateful for me to get pregnant again , and soon after that , i learned that it was going to be a boy , and then , when i was in the fifth month , we drove that we had lost our child . 
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of the two carbon atoms that are arranged in a particular way , on the left , and they get graphit , which is soft and dark . 
and this is an idea that , as i think , paul richard buchanan put very nice in a current essay , where he says , &quot; products are living arguments for how we should live our lives . &quot; 
we know what it is like when these guys on tv screaming around congress that the end of the world is naked if we don &apos;t really close their opinion , because that &apos;s what &apos;s happened to the dollar since the dollar has been around . 
so , you take blood drop , you don &apos;t get any more processing , you put it into a little device , and the device filters out the blood cells , and you leave it through , and you get a series of colors down there . 
if nothing else goes , get a dog . don &apos;t get a cat , get a dog out for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been away for six months if you get five minutes . 
it can be a design school in jerusalem , trying to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because as you know , put israel in a person , babies , a gas mask . 
i just want to tell you that the reason for this development is that the lawyers in these processes understood the more they turn into a case , the bigger their opportunity to save the lives of their clients . 
there are two kinds of choices that you make when you try to decide what &apos;s the right thing , and these are : error , in the estimation of success , and error at the estimation of success . 
in a small country -- whether it was my or her -- you decided to -- in fact , that all government decisions , the discussions of the ministry , 24 hours after they were going to be publicly publicly publicly on the internet . 
the pink mexicano restaurant , where he brings us to the beaches of acapulko , up at the upper west side , with this wall of rock pockets -- you can see it , just like this . 
they were born in stars like this , including this , and then given back to the universe , explosions like this , to sow themselves up and to form planets , stars , new solar systems , and truly , humans like us . 
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism fit all together into a package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the one we see . 
the other thing that we can do with information technologies is we start to figure out how to need less things by using the amount of things that we actually use , modest knowledge and also controlling that . 
hopefully we would understand the client in his inner world where he is at home by living with him in america , and so -- -- we sent the team off , and then , in fact , something else happened . they went on their own journey . 
and this bone is full of light , as you can see , light that appears through the skull , with all its deepening , the side caves that heat the air and fire that we breathe . 
as i said , i &apos;ve traveled to a lot of countries , and i &apos;ve seen when we do with the girl what we do , it &apos;s obviously terrifying to think about what we do to the girls in the world . 
this was confused , but there was nothing in the world that my sister wanted more than not amy , who was the last five year-old little sister , but amy , the mysterious unicorn . 
and it &apos;s about two anectodes -- one was in cambodia , in a village that had no electricity , no water , television or a telephone , but now with broadband internet . 
huntington kitchen . in huntington , where i &apos;ve done this show , you know , we &apos;re doing this program at the best time , which hopefully encourages people to participate in this change . 
the people in the modern , secular world , who are interested in spiritual issues , for awareness issues , for the higher , the more elite problems , are quite often isolated beings . 
we had fashion designers , installation scientists , models , we had maken-imagers , jewelry designers , all sorts of people who worked with me together to make an art installation from my wedding . 
we couldn &apos;t believe it could do that . it tells us that if you could build a robot with very simple federal legs , you could make it as agile as anything that has been built so far . 
instead , all the big threats of today are the problems that we &apos;ve all created , and since we &apos;ve created the problems , we can also solve them , and that means that it &apos;s completely in our power to address these problems . 
that means the work of innovation , the work of developing new ideas is one of the most powerful , one of the most fundamental work that we can do in a economical economy , and this is how used to innovate innovation . 
evolution was the same . we were teaching our kids , the bible says , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are plants , and they &apos;re not changing . 
but i knew what he meant , because it was possible to put some pictures of flowers in a backyard into a computer system so it looked like there was a real robot , although there is no one there . 
so we called it y water . so this is another example where everything goes together in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the brand development , it &apos;s all very closely interconnected . 
&quot; i think it &apos;s great that they &apos;ve managed to maintain most of what makes you feel connected to nature -- butterflies , crowded forests , made limestone caves and hey , a giant python . &quot; 
that while we could discover these strands of a &apos;s , t &apos;s c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we could discover a whole new class of life that , like beijerinck , the way we think about the nature of biology . 
we have never , like in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve seen a clear decline in ecosystem functions and services of the planet that are the ability to regulate climate in the long term , in our forests , in landscapes and diversity . 
i say to the guys when they &apos;re fighting up , and they feel that they can &apos;t continue to really help ignore the immediate obstacles and raise their head and see how the caution is growing around you . 
so the challenge was to get them to do what we wanted them to do , through weather observation , the nature of the soil and through things that let the sheep go , so they went to where we wanted it . 
they would stare us amaze if we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements , and they would be really irritated and wouldn &apos;t see what &apos;s wrong with us . 
in fact , she said that if we did this , it wouldn &apos;t just become a part of the joy that the extended family was grateful , but she said , &quot; god smiles , and when god smiles , god means peace , justice , joy . &quot; 
you know , i &apos;m so bad at technology that i &apos;m talking about my daughter -- which is now 41 -- when she was five , randomly listening to a friend , &quot; if it doesn &apos;t blur , if you cut it , my dad doesn &apos;t understand it . &quot; 
the company guidance took our stack , our list of incentives , and left the room for 17 minutes , and said , &quot; wow , this is the most generous thing a community ever did to keep jobs there . 
we &apos;re going to need to learn again what the single building blocks of these things are , the street , the block block of houses , how to create a public space that &apos;s at the same time large and small . the hyard , the public space , and how to use these institutions at the best . 
so first of all , if you &apos;re a character like the dancing guy with no shirt who dances himself , think about the importance of looking at their first followers as they &apos;re equally concerned , so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not to them . 
the best thing we can do is find ways to encourage business spirit and the vast unused potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t do that , they won &apos;t learn anything new and they &apos;ll be backed . 
a way to deal with the development of the modern world could be politics , and unfortunately , you can have liberal principles , you can classify logic in abstractions , but if you don &apos;t know the story and the other countries , you can &apos;t do politics . 
and to try that out -- i couldn &apos;t find a sponsor , but i went to the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have toilets , beyond the exhibition room , which one can use what i did . 
she gave them a book about life in the south that they had left behind , &quot; they were sitting around , reading the book , listening to me reading out of the book , and a piece of paradise was oblicted . &quot; 
anyway , i mean , an alternative primary education , whatever you think is there , where schools don &apos;t exist well enough , where schools are not available or where teachers aren &apos;t good enough , for whatever reason . 
and then we get to fish afterwards , and then we get to the monkey , and then we get what we are today : a super-monkey , and the funny thing is that our state today is only half the story . 
we have a lot of energy , so we &apos;re going to solve this problem , but biology is dark because we &apos;re going to suck out all these toxic materials that we spill through the system , we &apos;re never going to be able to do it again . 
i think there are new , hidden tensions that are actually interacting between people and institutions -- those institutions that people use in their daily lives : schools , hospitals , jobs , businesses , offices , and so on . 
to me , it means that you see the value of the difference , the joy that it brings with you if we don &apos;t focus on loss and limitations , but the power and happiness and detect the world from new exciting perspectives . 
the data here is this amazing thing called youtube , and we can basically go down and get all the content content out of youtube , all the comments , all the visits of who they look at , and what they &apos;re saying in the comments . 
and i used car-containers and students to build furniture , to make them living , everything is to the government budget , the area that takes the house is the same , but it &apos;s much more housing . 
and what the bayes-rule says is that you should multiply the number in the red with the number in the green to keep the number of yellow people pointing out the ellipses , and that &apos;s my belief . 
but if we reverse this formula fast , what we find is that acceleration is equal to force divided by mass , which means that for a greater particle , a bigger mass , more force needs to change direction . 
everybody knows that we can better deal with visual things that the patient can interact with , where you can see a video , and you can film it yourself , and you can press buttons . ok ? i don &apos;t . 
newton aduaka : thank you . i &apos;ve only -- the first excerpt , of these clips , is really trying to get really close to what cinema means for me , and how i do everything that goes to the cinema . 
and if you think that &apos;s really not a matter of meaning to you , remember that sound is possible , and that means that you go through childhood again , in which case you want to be heard just like my generation wants to do that . 
this exhibition is about the designers &apos; work that help us be more elastic , and also about designers working on this elasticity as a chance , and ultimately , it &apos;s not just the designers , but also the scientists . 
doug hofstadter asks , well , maybe our intelligence is simply not big enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , our brains would be more complicated , and we could never be more comfortable . 
so we grew up in the belief that no one would ever love us to be lonely lonely , no one would ever give us the sense that the sun was something that they had built us in their shoes . 
if we can break through this border , this uncomfortable , this tension , this feeling that we don &apos;t work enough in terms of social problems , we can break it through and ultimately , i think we &apos;ll find solutions . 
it all began when two scientists , fred grassle and jesse ausubel , in woods hole , massachusetts , when they were both known at the famous oceanographic institute . 
in many cases , it &apos;s not so much about changing something , it &apos;s about creating conditions where change is possible , and giving incentive to change . it &apos;s easier to do in rural communities and in a sealed education system in rural communities . 
what i &apos;m proposing is , as we read , writing arithmetic and american history , we should have a curriculum about the facts of all the religions in the world -- about their history , about their kredo , their text , their music , their symbols , their names , their needs . 
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she was looking at me at a party , how she was drunk , she fell , she was lying , shrinking rock , red surrounded eyes , wanting to disappear from tears , her shame , her mach . 
dean ornish shares new research scores that show how the acquisition of healthy life can affect a human on a genetic level , and he says that if we live healthier , better food , exercise and love , our brain cells are actually engaging . 
rob forbes , founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of snappies that his way of looking at the world , illustrating . charming objects , sparked art , urbane patterns -- this presentation will open you the eyes around the world . 
i didn &apos;t even have a specific address , but i knew that he was called abed , and i knew he &apos;d lived in a city with 15,000 people called kfar kara , and i knew he had 21 years before , outside of this holy city , had broken my neck . 
and i would say , we can &apos;t give up the rule of asymmetric threats , which seems to be , due to the cracks , seems to be doing this , the people in power do this , because that meant to give up a thing that makes civilization . 
the problem was , after we had done it a few years , i realized that maybe i was at six or seven programs , and you know , i thought , if i keep doing this in this pace , my whole career , maybe i &apos;ll go up to 20 or 30 grams . 
you decode what you want to fold up into a sequence of wincles -- so minus 120 , 120 , zero , 120 , minus 120 -- something in the way ; a sequence of wincles , or rotations , and you send that sequence through the chain . 
science and ethics , to be a democracy , are not only in relation to each other , but there are also , historically , a relationship between how people think about time and space and what the cosmos are , and how people think about society they live in . 
the adoption process took a few months , it was an industry , you know , a dedicated business , a propulable , useful solution : the government as a contractor , the optical options , the mother , the earth , the child who harvested . 
but since we &apos;ve eaten all the oysters , and all the fish that would eat the plankton , there &apos;s nothing more there that eats the plankton , and that &apos;s why there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies on aging weakness , which you &apos;ve never heard of plankton . 
so you can buy apps and buy apps inside this apps , but if you think about amazon , think about the trustworthinkers i showed you , according to the people , they start to trust companies , especially business they believe in as they trust governments . 
so it &apos;s very clear that , given those numbers , or all the other numbers i &apos;m talking about in my book , &quot; world 3.0 , &quot; very , very far from the policies for random borders , the international degree at 85 , 90 , 95 percent . 
summer time , and life is easy to jump the fish , and the cotton is already up to the oh , your dad is rich , and your mom looks good for silence , my little baby doesn &apos;t cry ! and when i opened the eyes again , i saw that the woman had closed her eyes . 
and now let me become less sentimental and say that life is saving -- which some help we get on this continent -- if you save a life , one farmer , a teacher , all these people can contribute to the economy . 
and that led to a view of human nature , that we are rational individuals that are responding in a straight way of rewards , and that led to the points of the world where people were trying to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior works . 
and like a living organism , where , when you put it on , the molded blood rushes , what to heat the wound up from the asthenosphere , becomes hardened , new tissue is shaping and moving sideways . 
but this -- process is what i consider as a science , where you start with an idea , and then , instead of just proposing every authority you &apos;ve ever heard of -- sometimes you do that , when you write an article later , you want to figure out who else has been working on it . 
and in the next 25 years , i lived in italy , living in america , i shared carefully parts of this romance to everybody who was paying for it . this sense , this aesthetic feeling , for the experience , which is a design ject . 
but what i need to do now , when i feel again , what i need to do is to be able to send enough of these enzymes from these extinctions early enough in the process that they arrive at them , not by their thinking , but by their feeling . 
if you look at the economy from these two different wincles , you can understand why this crisis is so difficult , the worse the crisis , the bigger the inputs , so every side believes to know the answer , and the other side will ruin . 
there &apos;s this big , focused agriculture that has led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since about 1980 , after the oil crisis , you know , of mass collision , mass exodus of small farmers in this country . 
but at least a great class of cases , you can think that the universe is , a kind of network that is large enough to negotiate like an infinite space , rather than if you have a lot of molecules that behave like a liquid . 
two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that shape your brain in the way that you &apos;re either designed to be confident and feel comfortable , or that you &apos;re very stressful and you feel like you don &apos;t have energy . we all know the feeling , right ? 
when the paper burned , he turned to me for some reason , and he said , &quot; mashelkar , so if you don &apos;t use your energy , if you focus your energy , you can do anything in the world . &quot; 
you can see an animation that goes from an example of what you would see without using the car , in other words , just a picture that shows the stars , and the frame is centered with the center of the galaxy , where we suspect the black hole . 
and the scale of my work , the ideas that i work with when i first saw an imax movie , i immediately thought , &quot; there is a resonance between what i want to do , and the scale of what i want to do as a photographer . &quot; 
it &apos;s easier to think of ourselves , the citizens , the police , the army , the good army , and the drowders and the cardals , we should consider that they provide one service on the other . 
what happens is , in fact , what happened before was local , individuals or groups of extremists who were isolated by each other are now connected in globalized ways , so or are being established in this way . 
with the same persistence that my father had moved to me since i was little -- he taught me the sailing , even though he knew i could never see where i was going , never seeing the shore , or the sea sphere , never the target . 
and it &apos;s critical , in a practical and activist sense , that people who are concerned with these issues make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , their preferences , their decisions and their voices are about to support a result . 
but if you look at the map , and you look at our state of michigan here -- it &apos;s legal to fire people because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , it &apos;s legal to flip somebody out of their home because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , you realize that this whole talk about marriage is not about protecting somebody &apos;s rights , but it &apos;s about the rights that are already buried . 
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him , left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center , where he worked , &quot; honey , i love you . i want you to know that i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; and she slept because it was three o &apos;clock at night when he called her back and said , &quot; honey , i can &apos;t tell you what that means to me . &quot; 
i used to say that these people have rescued me , but now i know that they &apos;ve done something much more important than they enabled me to save myself , and , very crucial , they helped me understand something that i always suspected that my voices had a meaningful reaction to traumatic life , especially childhood experiences , and therefore my enemies were not a detection source of emotional problems . 
and what i &apos;ve been trying to do since i was trained as a medical illustrator -- since i was taught by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual adviser , was taught in animation -- is to find a way to help people understand the truth and beauty of biological sciences -- through animations , through stories , by things that don &apos;t necessarily seem obvious to people , to be understood and understood . 
i had an inconclusive laboratory to answer this question , the real question , which is : what &apos;s the difference in someone &apos;s life if you looked at one of the people you gave it all ? how did all the resources that they were going to use ? not a cheap computer you gave them , the best calculator you gave them . you loved them , you gave them a gift . you were waiting for them . 
this is a call for all the things that we love about mexico -- the feasts , the markets , the bars , the tequila , the mariachi , the serenades , the posades , the day of the dead , san guel , the joy , the lust , the struggle , everything it means to be mexican -- not from the world . 
i was at our university of medicine , the carolina institute , a class called global health in undergraduate school , but if you get an opportunity , you get something nervous . i said the students who come to us have the best degree you can get in the swedish high school system , and you might know anything i want to teach you . so i &apos;ve got it . 
in fact , we believe that it &apos;s possible to reach 100 percent , even in 2015 , in other parts of the emerging markets , like india and china , there were good progress -- the stable ones were good , but they didn &apos;t develop areas like africa , latin america and other regions of the world , they were rather advanced . i just went to south africa recently . 
if people ask for these two different places , one place where they &apos;re getting $ 6,000 , they &apos;re going to earn 50 , 1,000 , they &apos;re going to have a place where they &apos;re going to get a barrement every year , and one where they &apos;re going to get a threat , people who prefer to the second one , although they said they &apos;re going to make a lot less money . why ? 
and it &apos;s a feeling that urges me to be here today . the knowledge that we prescribed women as bots for all of this , but also as those who have the responsibility for the children . as mothers , we have the greatest buying power in our household . it &apos;s to go forward and drive the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world . 
so what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve taken some of the money that we &apos;ve collected in australia to bring the campaign to this country , to the united states and to england , and we &apos;ve done it because we knew that if it was successful , we could finally raise a lot more money worldwide than just in australia , and that drives the research and will bring us a cure . 
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , like , when you think about the civilizations that we consider to be greater points of human achievement , whether this is china , greece , the civilization of hindus , or mayas , the egyptians -- what we know about them is about their ecstases , rather than their everyday lives . 
between australia and here , right , we &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- rast the earth in a sense against the sun at night , and then round back ? i mean , this is a funny thing that &apos;s going on there , and we &apos;ve got these two models in the head of what &apos;s right and what we don &apos;t do , and we &apos;re doing that as humans , on all possible fields . 
there are three trucks . you instinctively take the white one , because that &apos;s the top truck in your view . but you &apos;ll remember , &quot; oh , he doesn &apos;t see him , so i should move the blue truck , &quot; the top of his eye . believe it or not normal , healthy adults like they do in half of the time , in those trials . 
and i order them . and , well , yes , it &apos;s also a little different than an architect compared to , let &apos;s say , a dance group is an investigation between the private world , the worlds of their own concepts , the ideas , the longing , the inventions , with the outside world and the constraints , the inventations . 
because if you spend a lot of time getting from place to place , from land to land , from town to city , the scale of women , for example , being mixed , and the epidemic of it , and the usual thing is so devastating for the soul , you have to take the time , at least i have to take the time to process it . 
in those days , there were rural areas , near the city , caves , cornfields , cows , even from our house , with his descended stones and the long , sharp corridor , you could find areas of hills and trees , and you could do that as mountains and forests . 
what &apos;s important here is that , when you start looking at people with these disorders , these every fifth that &apos;s rumquing to look at it , you find that there are many forms of play , how the brain is wired , but there are predictable patterns , and these patterns are risk-risk factors , that one of those disorders is evolving . 
what we need is a new generation of heroes , especially those of us who live in the united states today , but also the rest of the world has to understand that the story has given us a choice -- as jill bolte taylor found out how she could save her life while she was living through the amazing experience she was distracted . 
and i thought , well , if this is a creation model , if we were making music the first line , fulfilling the form for this , and if we were to do art hanging on walls of art galleries and museums , and if we write programs that fits to existing operating systems , is this what ? 
and the reality of society that we live in is that there are thousands and thousands of thousands of people out there who live their lives in the silent cry of despair , working for hours in hate jobs to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like . 
and then you know , for these works of lawsenidentities , she told me basically that the work on the right , obviously , was done by a black artist on the left , the work of a white artist , of course , was the opposite of the case . bob colescott , african-american artist , leon golub , a white artist . 
it turns out that a force inherently inherited , because people feel that these leaders were on the tax , not because they liked to guide others , and not because they enjoyed being watched , they were there because they didn &apos;t have any choice because they were designed to do what they thought was right . 
and the good thing about the perception of ultraviolet is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day for the sunbathing , because ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can kill us , and so i think we should all wish to perceive something that &apos;s not possible . 
if you &apos;re 50 percent , you &apos;re going to drop out to the 14th year of life , 75 percent to 24th year , an image that &apos;s very different from what you &apos;re talking about when you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension -- most of the big diseases that we know about as causality for disease and mortality . 
during that time , do everything : go out and explore ethnographically and find a need to come back to the studio , brainstorming and visualization of design , concepts that could work , and then test it in the commercial space , create prototypes , find if they will work , and they enemize it . 
the particular kind of dragonflies i &apos;d like to talk about are now this one , because most dragonflies , like the ones i just showed you , the adult is only in the short run of one , two months in life , it doesn &apos;t make a big jumble . it can &apos;t be too far . 
and it &apos;s going to be suborbital , and the reason it has to be sub-orbital is that there are no extending security solutions to fly in orbit with passengers . governments are doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and yet four percent of the people who have left the atmosphere . 
so lula , he &apos;s full of problems , full of contradictions , but one of the things he &apos;s doing is he &apos;s making an idea of how we can participate in international relations that move the balance away from the classic north-south dialogue to a whole new kind of global collaboration . 
samuel pisar , once the survivors of auschwitz , i said , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its most crumful moments , is still in contrast to humans , when it loses its moral orientation and failure . &quot; 
give me a man who can sit with a woman who can &apos;t do anything , and his first reaction is not , &quot; i &apos;ve cleaned out the washing machine , &quot; which is really listening -- because this is all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who has done a lot . 
and we did that , we traveled around , and we talked to the oldest , with the doctors , with the nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with the isaf and we sat down with the nato , we sat down with the government of the united kingdom .
