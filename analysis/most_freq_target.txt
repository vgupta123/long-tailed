thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
invest . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
thank you . 
yes . 
thank you . 
no . 
yeah . 
oh .

last . 
ok . 
okay . 
yeah . 
thank you . 
us . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
but , yeah . 
mo : data . 
freeways . 
move it . 
thank you . 
wonderful engine . 
data is relationships . 
thanks . 
kt : no . 
it was awful . 
idea about women . 
the bride . 
there was hollywood . 
very very hard . 
good afternoon . 
thank you . 
wassup . 
tedx . 
useless . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
all right . 
529 . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
no big deal . 
my technology . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thanks very much . 
good afternoon . 
he &apos;s dying . 
it really is . 
right ? good . 
here we go . 
never have been . 
oh , wonderful . 
and then finally ... 
no other evidence . 
think about war . 
thank you , thank you . 
i don &apos;t think so . 
and this was 2007 . 
it &apos;s unbelievable . 
bye-bye . 
so thank you very much . 
which they do . 
all right , next . 
so , yeah . 
so here he is . 
you &apos;re happy . 
an amazing woman . 
the opposite happened . 
i was seven . 
don &apos;t ask . 
it was extraordinary . 
here &apos;s some numbers . 
without the sex part . 
one in a hundred . 
it &apos;s been fantastic . 
it &apos;s just wrong . 
pretty clever , right ? 
so ideas change states . 
three different options . 
that &apos;s one city . 
he was obsessed . 
everybody &apos;s welcome . 
it was boring . 
here &apos;s another one . 
we must change everything . 
and that makes sense . 
technology is transformational . 
it &apos;s right here . 
you know the story . 
i really was moved . 
one person wins . 
that looks like this . 
he takes basically everything . 
n thank you . 
businesses want different things . 
audience : february . 
this is 1983 . 
everyone showed up . 
they laughed together . 
so i read slowly . 
this much , right ? 
they got themselves ready . 
we had plans . 
awful , really awful . 
it didn &apos;t work . 
that &apos;s very important . 
make room for it . 
it was incredibly successful . 
i was so proud . 
second , economic growth . 
so most everyone watches tv . 
ok , any six of them . 
yes , you know it . 
it &apos;s so uninteresting . 
all of that is over . 
and this is happening here . 
you see him all the time . 
that was astonishing . 
this was how computing began . 
it &apos;s the coolest stuff . 
this is where we stand today . 
but i didn &apos;t find any . 
she rides her bicycle . 
it &apos;s easy to bend . 
so i was filming . 
thanks , scott . 
and that &apos;s the end . 
that &apos;s so true . 
every school succeeds . 
these are major issues . 
we were very successful . 
girl : holly . 
that &apos;s a lot . 
i just observed . 
we have to change . 
and the answer is no . 
the design comes from within . 
thank you . all right . 
academia says no . 
so we started giving back . 
he viewed talent differently . 
and now all bets are off . 
so i showed him . 
thank you very much . 
we tell ourselves stories . 
so here we go . 
we are running late . 
the electricity is free . 
in mother &apos;s milk . 
that &apos;s the change . 
thank you very much . 
they &apos;re all different . 
it &apos;s really serious . 
and now , 2012 . 
it was all these things . 
they &apos;re just not moving . 
i loved getting as . 
you knew ! 
yes , contrast . 
we do it again . 
but they were empty . 
wish i could . 
god bless . 
it changed my life . 
anyway , moving along . 
the science is clear . 
not silicon . 
bring it back up . 
it &apos;s too late . 
everybody knew the answer . 
the majority of people . 
but that moved me . 
i brought it here . 
this is the death star . 
and so he agreed . 
the navigation is difficult . 
it is an easy answer . 
you know that , right ? 
so , huge tragedy . 
i pulled them aside . 
that &apos;s two days ago . 
there &apos;s just one problem . 
and that was really cool . 
audience : six . six . 
it &apos;s that pyramid . 
glamorous and rich . 
and this influenced me . 
it &apos;s just impossible . &quot; 
you act compassionately . 
but that &apos;s not all . 
everything else is mandated . 
because the world is big . 
but let &apos;s play along . 
it felt like a revolution . 
this is my big wish . 
that &apos;s about that big . 
it &apos;s motion and emotion . 
this was a great thing . 
so here &apos;s a tumor . 
there is one more decision . 
here we have a problem . 
you can see the detail . 
all open , all available . 
one , play is universal . 
and we &apos;re getting there . 
the age is 400 years . 
i want to talk about this . 
i will come to it later . 
this is probably a better picture . 
she doesn &apos;t see the point . 
they belonged to boys . 
and that &apos;s what she does . 
it &apos;s been a good ride . 
the question was , where from ? 
let &apos;s put it that way . 
and he &apos;s on a mission . 
he went into a coma . 
so , what do you think ? 
there &apos;s many of them up there . 
unfortunately , it &apos;s not the answer . 
and it has to be free . 
so that &apos;s one thing . 
it &apos;s a crap system . 
we &apos;re very used to this . 
and this is after two years . 
so i will do this . 
that &apos;s the financial crisis . 
they don &apos;t read music . 
so thank you very much . 
every dot is a person . 
even that wasn &apos;t enough . 
and wikipedia has embraced this . 
they just don &apos;t like it . 
we feel so good about ourselves . 
it looks a bit like this . 
that &apos;s all great , right ? 
so they snapped into action . 
so , it was going nowhere . 
that is outrageous . 
i know it works . 
audience : raw . 
i almost miss it . 
it &apos;s so uncomfortable . 
and that &apos;s the way i work now . 
and it been growing for about 600 years . 
they &apos;re also very obsessed with status . 
we needed to be working on beef . 
and i tell you stories from there . 
and so that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . 
that &apos;s the order of the day here . 
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem . 
they &apos;re related distantly to thylacines . 
and so this is what they do . 
that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not true . 
actually it was a very hard challenge . 
now , this one &apos;s pretty cool . 
meet tony . he &apos;s my student . 
so we need to start getting better . 
here we have &#91; the &#93; year . 
it &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing . 
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes . 
it literally flat-lined . 
and this was , unfortunately , successful . 
and then something happened in 1980 . 
and this starts happening all the time . 
and that &apos;s what it looks like . 
it was used indiscriminately . 
and we had an increase in income . 
people , you can all do that . 
so we &apos;re zooming in . 
i just put this inside this . 
well , here is the image . 
and that was what i did . 
so the key here is empathy . 
you &apos;re sitting on chairs . 
they were actually attacking them . 
you , you can teach it . 
so where do we go now ? 
but it &apos;s not that simple . 
and i was part of that . 
louis kahn , yes ! 
and they &apos;re not all bad . 
we can heal the disease . 
this is not trivial . 
i was like , &quot; yeah . 
&quot; the snail . &quot; 
that &apos;s my social experience . &quot; 
i believe in real life . 
it &apos;s a commercial example . 
it sounds something like this . 
it became part of me . 
there &apos;s the continent africa . 
it protects the birds . 
perfectly nice thing to do . 
they send him to iraq . 
resolutions , smoke . 
this was a critical mistake . 
they thought this was fundamental . 
and you see this post . 
you must stop . stop . 
and you even find a church . 
and then you heard the original . 
but the pay-off is really enormous . 
you must be out of your mind . &quot; 
i &apos;m not on top of the class . 
in architecture , it works just the same . 
so , how do you make education better ? 
and bees are very faithful . 
i would like to share with you this . 
&quot; papi , help . &quot; 
so , back to the public meeting . 
now , so i know the frequency . 
thank you . jy : thank you . 
now , this is the very interesting part . 
and the woman would have sex with it . 
now there &apos;s a talent unto itself . 
they don &apos;t need the sun at all . 
she &apos;s highly athletic . 
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot; 
it &apos;s a very simple example . 
it &apos;s certainly not like china . 
their decisions , their actions matter . 
we go on blind dates . 
and it &apos;s not a diet . 
ts : thank you , john . 
she &apos;s a high school student . 
yes ? zoe : yeah . 
this is that rocket going up . 
but it was only the beginning . 
and then , finally hits the floor . 
my ancestors moved to the united states . 
so i &apos;ll just let you read . 
that &apos;s the responsibility of architects . 
there &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece . 
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot; 
governments are not changing it . why ? 
and there will be no mistakes . &quot; 
namaste . salaam . 
secondly , making them interactive . 
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true . 
again , &quot; inward out . &quot; 
for example , it stimulates creativity . 
you all know the story , right . 
the programmers come and go . 
yes , it &apos;s going to continue . 
a new frontier has been found . 
well done , ladies and gentlemen . 
roger . i got &apos; em . 
but this is the source of innovation . 
and that &apos;s what &apos;s nice about emotion . 
ah , mark -- serfaas . 
i accept where we are . 
and that &apos;s the sad part . 
and they haven &apos;t collapsed . 
that &apos;s what engineers do . &quot; 
chromosome one , top left . 
and we have a cool atmosphere . 
and nokia as well . 
but i do that all the time . 
thank you for being here . 
and of course , it turns into a circle . 
&quot; it &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot; 
we need data , we don &apos;t need help . 
you can continue to innovate and invent . 
it kills me . i &apos;m not kidding . 
this is exactly what happens in your body . 
is it that i write very well ? 
and i think that &apos;s probably right . 
and we knew we were right . 
but yes there are some solutions . 
and they tried everything they had . 
of course , you got it wrong . 
i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot; 
well , we looked at the tissue under the microscope . 
they &apos;re completely anonymous , as it were . 
we have liberia . we have congo . 
in the spinal ward , that &apos;s normal . 
so you can get kind of a feel for this . 
and that &apos;s how i got out of high school . 
and we all had all of that on tapes . 
and that &apos;s pretty much why i do it . 
i &apos;ll show you what they look like . 
they can get basic utilities like electricity . 
it &apos;s the most important map of all . 
open your hand . thank you very much . 
come right over here , next to me . 
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do . 
and i drew it out for her . 
i say , &quot; online organizing . &quot; 
but people did not relate to this . 
and i &apos;ll show you a graph here . 
and i went to see the dozo . 
so , let me show you what happens . 
but that &apos;s not what &apos;s interesting about this . 
that &apos;s what i get asked all the time . 
necessity is the mother of evolution . 
you know , we have to go through that . 
we so rarely look at the sky . 
sorrow , anger , mourning . 
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out . 
recording : okay , here &apos;s something . 
okay , that &apos;s severin hacker . 
being a leader gives you charisma . 
all right . mike , thanks so much . 
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more . 
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes . 
and i believe that . i believe that . 
you think , &quot; ha , ha , ha . 
now , diabetes is one of the big ones . 
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic . 
humans yawn when others yawn . 
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order . 
and yes , the red planet is red . 
so let me explain how this works . 
sometimes they assume i am deaf . 
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait . 
and that was the language of the war . 
so those are the three a &apos;s . 
and we know that there are more . 
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy . 
there can be different ways doing this . 
so let &apos;s see what that looks like . 
sometimes you gotta lose to win . 
and i didn &apos;t know what to do . 
they want to make people live in fear . 
and i thought , &quot; well , hey ! 
that &apos;s a challenge . i like this . 
and then you ask , why economists ? 
tm : oh , 10 , 11 . 
it &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory . 
that &apos;s one way of looking at it . 
it &apos;s all about more , having more . 
first of all , listen consciously . 
and i think that &apos;s a mistake . 
it is about what we feed them . 
yeah , retail therapy might help . 
so you can imagine how that works . 
but i know i needed to . 
i think that is wrong . 
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here . 
that &apos;s what we all need to do . 
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this . 
now i know you don &apos;t think that . 
they want us to fit in even better . 
invest , invest , invest . &quot; 
ok , this is mount everest . 
red means they &apos;re stuck . 
you know , if they said , you know what ? 
the signs don &apos;t look good , some have said . 
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment . 
and this is what the next piece is about . 
and the same is true for the troops . 
they are skating . they are doing street plays . 
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice . 
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on now . 
i find a lot of people have difficulty doing that . 
richard preston , thank you very much , i think . 
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human . 
we have to turn it , go up and go down . 
this is extremely practical , but not so awesome . 
it &apos;s good for them . they make a lot of money . 
and this is exactly the symbol of our world . 
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that . 
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read . 
i need two people to help me out real quick . 
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot; 
so , how far does eternity go ? 
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here . 
and he called the two of them to his office . 
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in poland . 
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot; 
you get stressed , you do some meditation . 
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot; 
okay , we have parachute aligned . 
well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing . 
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap . 
it is finite ; harmony is infinite . 
it &apos;s too late . that is gone . 
and she said , &quot; what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot; 
the schools need you . the teachers need you . 
maybe have the same kind of security to play . 
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough . 
in fact , it &apos;s continued to increase . 
that &apos;s where babies were born and people died . 
now , we have a rationale for that . 
we were up in the mountains , 1976 . 
let &apos;s see what people here think about it . 
if you don &apos;t believe me , just ask sam . 
and nano was , bang , 2,000 dollars . 
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know . 
you become your nation . you become your religion . 
i mean , i find information just too interesting . 
pretty much everybody else who does polls . 
okay , just wait for this one . this is good . 
unacceptable . nepriemliv . 
it was a way of locating myself . 
and that &apos;s what the song is asking . 
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical . 
corruption ? poverty ? or is it something else ? 
the second reason is that we killed these things . 
they look like , maybe like sunflowers . 
and is it easy to raise that money ? 
i think that really leads nowhere . 
it would be great if the story ended there . 
difficult , eh ? it &apos;s meaningless . 
we are only happy when things are in order . 
pm : so is this a good idea . 
we will fly where the methane is . 
a government dependent upon the people alone . 
we get one from mom , one from dad . 
i come back up , not for air . 
so , look what they did . 
oh , after you stopped paying . 
i mean , they went to the max for this woman . 
i must admit , i used to be one of them . 
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google . 
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool . 
but it &apos;s all good in the grand scheme of things . 
hi there . i &apos;m hasan . i &apos;m an artist . 
i think i have to say goodbye now . 
now try and wrap your head around that for a second . 
now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ? 
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started . 
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ? 
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with . 
and i think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on . 
that &apos;s exactly what people used to say to sue . 
there is more of it than you think , actually . 
and i think that &apos;s a fundamentally interesting question . 
that &apos;s the first invention that i wanted to describe . 
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet . 
it will stop because of the end of trade resources . 
exactly . because i &apos;m not even touching it . 
e : quack , quack , quack . 
let me show you what you could do right now . 
and that was largely because there weren &apos;t any . 
they think a punishment is something nasty . 
well , it has its pluses and minuses . 
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with . 
pure content and pure form , side by side . 
they &apos;re exotic . they &apos;re experimental . 
anyway . so i &apos;m going to jump ahead . 
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through . 
those are very important , critically important to us . 
and just down the road , this is jet . 
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough . 
serious problems , big problems , pressing problems . 
i knew which woman i would like to take . 
as one gets older ? very , very common . 
you &apos;re a good person . you complain . 
we &apos;ll wait for the slow ones . ok . 
there are no patents . anyone can make it . 
now recently , there &apos;s been development in this field . 
when he aimed , he never missed . 
i realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement . 
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people . 
can of whup ass , the networking force . 
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen what that does . 
it was perfectly clear . i didn &apos;t do any thinking about it . 
voice 1 : it &apos;s coming again . voice 2 : new wave ? 
in fact , i &apos;m finished . science will never go away . 
and i believe there &apos;s a way for us to do that . 
this one is one of my favorites , belmar . 
and it was deep . it was deep in my soul . 
it &apos;s in your hands and my hands and those of our children . 
this is terrible , this oil -- it &apos;s in the water . 
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy . 
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem . 
now there are other ways the system can be inhibited . 
or snowmobiles . you don &apos;t need the snow . 
so anyway , you &apos;ve got basically an idea of where things came from . 
so i &apos;m passionate about teaching these fls skills all over the world . 
they instantly knew why they woke up in the morning . 
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working . 
yes , hairstyling -- i insist on that . 
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is . 
as you can see , it &apos;s blocking her vision . 
i just got this impression that the money would work . 
the inventors don &apos;t know what the invention is . 
they recognize : both of these things have to live together . 
and i said , &quot; i want to do that . &quot; 
so what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution . 
these become forthright in places we need to protect . 
very odd -- i &apos;ve analyzed this for a while . 
and if you can , just scribble a pattern . 
we &apos;re interested in big displays , bright displays . 
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days . 
with that , i have to adapt to something new . 
then , after a few weeks , we set up camps . 
but really , really natural sovereignty was good for japan . 
and if you can do that , incredible things happen . 
i traveled to iraq , afghanistan and liberia . 
but they have no incentive to do so . 
these are some pictures visitors sent to me . 
message number three : don &apos;t leave before you leave . 
we need an anti-templeton to step forward . 
they need to be alive , they need to feed . 
so this is the internet they have in mind . 
and it was his universe on punch cards . 
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing . 
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything . 
it &apos;s all bad . my brothers get everything . &quot; 
and -- oh , i saw goldie hawn . 
often what jams us up is sewage . 
rather enjoying what the soloist is doing . 
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns . 
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds . 
look at them first . look at them first . 
ok , now , allow it to stay there . 
it causes them to distort reality . 
well three sons got into a negotiation . 
this is my office . it &apos;s out there . 
they &apos;re inexpensive , really rugged . 
and then we have silk , thai silk . 
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it . 
why not ? i think this is rather important . 
she said , &quot; change your profession . &quot; 
we know our societies have to radically change . 
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot; 
i talk about unthinking situations all the time . 
now i know that seems ludicrous . 
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions . 
so this is the footage that i was showing everybody . 
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain . 
bl : all right . one , two , three . 
and people in white hats sailing boats . 
ears are made not for hearing , but for listening . 
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are . 
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person . 
and you can win when you &apos;re outscored . 
that was cool because then i had retail outlets . 
well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health . 
maybe we should make people save more when they make more money . 
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in . 
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids . 
once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy . 
benevolence , loving kindness against hatred . 
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before . 
so envision what it looks like all wrapped up . 
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view . 
there are 100,000 there . it would take you all day . 
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen . 
those cold , hard winters , i love it . 
but he doesn &apos;t do miracles just to show off . 
the short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from japan . 
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job . 
so when i do my job , people hate me . 
we need to act like the future depends on it . 
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s what we do . 
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food . 
and the later it fails , the worse the consequences . 
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex . 
it &apos;s kind of neat . what a wonderful design . 
great . cool . so i was really interested in quantity . 
and i can &apos;t have my posse laughin &apos; at me . 
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good . 
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies . 
we want to eat , not be eaten by , our food . 
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on . 
ok , now , do you believe in witchcraft at all ? 
you can actually see , right here , it will vibrate . 
and , you know , built the society that we now live in . 
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ? 
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much . 
all right , well thank you all so much for joining us . 
so , what &apos;s needed now is to rebuild these boundaries . 
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to have kids . 
aid cannot solve our problems , i &apos;m firmly convinced about that . 
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources . 
but we have a new hope . we have a new man . 
it &apos;s very painful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything . 
so the goal was to evacuate the target cities . 
really , consciousness is seated in the frontal lobe . 
100 million bucks -- hey , i can go to the moon . 
and that &apos;s true . but it also goes deeper than that . 
if you have errors , you can replace a part . 
don &apos;t be too aggressive , it doesn &apos;t work . 
and these are the two concepts i &apos;d like to explore . 
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now . 
animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch . 
ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published . 
i don &apos;t know where julian morrow got that from . 
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ? 
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know . 
so , for example , there is the character of noora . 
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together . 
and i found these maps which you see here . 
no , because the wind should get in trouble . 
milo : i wonder how deep it is . 
but remember , greece is there today . 
and can you send me a bullet ? &quot; 
all i have to do is humbly follow . 
ok , so that &apos;s the healing one . 
you know i sat at home and i watched . 
and so we tend to worship ourselves . 
i designed the process that generated the form . 
people wrote in for reprints of that thing . 
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story . 
now , about that cow model i talked about . 
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment . 
&quot; uh-huh ... &quot; she said . 
so we perceive nothing as what it really is . 
but i wanted to try and enrich him . 
this is what we are using . &quot; 
we hope to have that built this fall . 
but again , it &apos;s kind of surprising . you wouldn &apos;t really expect that . 
and the chinese said to me , &quot; dr. barnett , you &apos;re absolutely right . 
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hurry . she &apos;s got food . 
twenty-three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot; 
that &apos;s right , that &apos;s right ; i &apos;m no longer a victim . 
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it . 
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , rosie . 
and that &apos;s how this was done . it &apos;s actually slice , slice . 
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill . 
so if you don &apos;t know one of these languages , it &apos;s instant learning . 
you can quit i.m. ; you can &apos;t hide your manager . 
and to her , that spoke of a kind of attentiveness that she needed . 
so we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well . 
this , all this bad news , is preventable . 
do you remember the story ? no , it was big . 
there has never been a company that doesn &apos;t have competition . 
i rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body . 
so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan . 
these are the classic conditions that create regret . 
and so i realized it was o.k. to go . 
we &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run . 
it &apos;s certainly what i learned when i was training . 
so , this device here is an invisibility cloak . 
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental . 
when i lift the heap , i peek . 
you already heard about that . you know what that means . 
but it &apos;s very hard to create that in standard ways . 
i discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way . 
so this was a trick to get these two sides . 
i was lying on a thin , hard spinal bed . 
as we go smaller , here is a human hair . 
but it is difficult to hear the words aloud . 
well what they found was mislabeled fish . 
i truly believe it &apos;s where dignity starts . 
half of them deserted to go look for gold . 
and i couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic . 
that means we get our new hips for free . 
we have names for places where people don &apos;t exist . 
believe it or not , some of us do survive . 
well we know that that was not a cheap war . 
i said , &quot; what am i going to say ? 
and that somehow , prediction leads to intelligent behavior . 
some of the studies even say we &apos;re happier . 
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here . 
if you develop a disease , you &apos;re off the island . 
so eight of us went in : four men and four women . 
and then it &apos;s time to do it again . last year . 
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot; 
it &apos;s that shape because the helium has to expand . 
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively . 
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of . 
and when she got to the house she was greeted . 
and that &apos;s all we seem to be caring about recently . 
and i said , &quot; yes , like the humane society . 
my son , he says he is not ready to get married . 
so i thought that it will be good to start with it . 
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distinctive stage . 
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola . 
i don &apos;t deserve it . i don &apos;t deserve anything . 
ladies and gentlemen , i &apos;d like to end before time . 
now let &apos;s assume you go on holiday . 
standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence . 
and frankly , i face a big obstacle . 
now , the opposite of a snob is your mother . 
it lasts forever . it &apos;s a very strange medium . 
had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do . 
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education . 
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo . 
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade . 
i mean really though , information seems like our best hope . 
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there . 
this is the straight truth , the righteous truth . 
and when they do , i &apos;m in the queue . 
and when you &apos;re told this , you feel kind of weird . 
so we &apos;ve all heard about the amish giving up cars . 
we need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing . 
i became the captain of the team , and that was great . 
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology . 
i &apos;m an ecologist , and i study complexity . i love complexity . 
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team . 
that &apos;s a potential scenario if we fail to take this seriously . 
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna . 
i get to do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible . 
honestly , better or worse ? say , &quot; aye . &quot; 
it &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mixed motives . 
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot; 
ts : yeah , well let &apos;s put a couple of canvases . 
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures . 
if you take a close-up of those , they look like this . 
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of nowhere . 
they were living on top of the workshops where they were working . 
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few . 
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die . 
those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies . 
to be more accurate , i wanted to be a pop star . 
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes . 
so , there &apos;s a couple of things to say about tms . 
when the mission was over , they actually landed on the thing . 
bf : ten years to perfect , which you &apos;re about to see . 
we don &apos;t really believe in cameras to do things in homes . 
and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely . 
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things . 
fireworks displays , the smell of perfume : no . 
i can see i &apos;ve got my work cut out for me here . 
again , it &apos;s useful to think about this analogy with language . 
which leads us to the last one , which is our elections . 
colin camerer : neuroscience , game theory , monkeys 
so , imagine that all of you are participants in the study . 
i think that &apos;s got to be scaring a lot of animals away . 
it &apos;s a compound curve interior . 
i was thinking about making my own little rockets . 
imagine making all of our hard materials that way . 
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything . 
we discovered they work by intermolecular forces alone . 
well , this is about state budgets . 
valence means good or bad , positive or negative . 
that &apos;s the region where entropy is low . 
but the gene that regulates that down is broken . 
but we feel like this could work in other places . 
it &apos;s really cold ; it &apos;s 24,000 feet . 
it &apos;s this brain which makes this reflex . 
it took me hours and hours a day to build my skills up to the next level . 
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game . 
we &apos;ve talked about mobility and the rest of it , let &apos;s talk about health . 
well it turns out that yes , the different tasks are interdependent . 
and we will live in a very peaceful world . thank you very much . 
and i &apos;m like that &apos;s not rubber at all , you know . 
so , i decided that i wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism . 
so we have the finger blasters . other people have dinosaurs , you know . 
i &apos;m working to try and break down that sense of that elitism . 
now , it goes down to a. now to g. and then to f . 
this should have been given to a boy . we can &apos;t do this . &quot; 
it &apos;s more than one device , you know , it &apos;s renewable . 
i didn &apos;t want them to be overly threatening or scary . 
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today . 
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clearer . 
i see a lot of children . they are walking up and down stairs . 
one of the things i do a lot is public-private partnerships . 
i &apos;ll spend a fortune on it . i &apos;ve got a better idea . 
they &apos;ll keep an eye on me to make sure i don &apos;t do anything funny . 
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things . 
and that &apos;s clearer now than it &apos;s been for decades . 
and that , i think , is an idea worth spreading . 
those are things that are different for each m.s. patient . 
it certainly didn &apos;t prepare me for what came next . 
but it &apos;s also clear that prosperity goes beyond this . 
so we can study this as a physical , intuitive model . 
we don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet . 
right ? a patient in the driver &apos;s seat , for example . 
and when we drop the ballast overboard we climb . 
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing . 
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment . 
oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature . 
now , corn originated , we think , in mexico . 
you see , it &apos;s not as dramatic as the tsunami . 
prime numbers , gauss , one of my favorites . 
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-dressed . 
we explained we would have number three mailed to them . 
and to take that even further , this is a heart . 
so they take the first one that comes along , often . 
so i think we have this whole eating thing wrong . 
i would like to encourage you to open your mind . 
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more . 
i guess you can only have one miracle per building . 
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interventions . 
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about . 
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives . 
this book i wrote because i want to figure out life . 
actually , that was aristotle &apos;s answer too . 
watch what happens when the foot goes onto your sandwich . 
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers . 
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago . 
so this mutual inspiration promotes collaboration , initiative and creativity . 
you know , audiences like you , yeah , make the event . 
these are the basic features of my device , or our device . 
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom . 
the future , as we know it , is very unpredictable . 
okay , i cheated , it was a mere 20 seconds . 
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring . 
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it . 
instead of investing in a car , we invest in a community . 
they &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly . 
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere . 
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have . 
and we chose to use the prescription for that purpose . 
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that . 
ben saunders : yeah , hi , ben saunders . 
and there is no way , and no proof of arrival . 
it didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace . 
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere . 
because i &apos;m going to the internet , which is where everybody goes . 
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner . 
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; shakespeare said . 
722 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one . 
many of you , i think , have probably trekked here . 
this was one of the biggest factories i &apos;ve ever seen . 
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects . 
of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures . 
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right . 
a few of these . this is atilla the hen . 
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you . 
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure . 
you had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it . 
we put the citizen first , and not the clerks . 
this is even a more interesting solution in seoul , korea . 
not the painter , i don &apos;t want to think about the painter . 
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom . 
some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top . 
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , allegedly there &apos;s nothing . 
and so in 1997 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together . 
this is the term that armies use when they &apos;ve lost a battle . 
bl : this is the epitome of technology . right . okay . 
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you . 
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan . 
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means . 
so , aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ? 
he depends , for his power , on his ability to make other people powerful . 
champion sounds so goofy , but it &apos;s what it was , right ? 
then , if in that framework , you take a bunch of theoreticians . 
but what they were very good at doing was making it very localized . 
we have secularized badly , i would argue . 
after he died , i realized that no one writes to me anymore . 
so , &quot; i saw many trains and also rode on one . 
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this . 
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures . 
and all of it was coming from this : shrimp farms . 
where &apos;s art ? i got productivity . i got sports . 
this means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates . 
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t . 
no doubt that it &apos;s going to happen , in my mind . 
in fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different . 
the nigerian filmmakers really , really , are doing what they like . 
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be loyal to it . 
we can turn the volume up a little bit if that &apos;s available . 
but , uh-oh , the killers are within the camps . 
so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game . 
the threat is serious , and the time to prepare for it is now . 
the other partners that we have got is business communities . 
shameless . shameless . shameless . 
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace . 
but it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful . 
but they can show you how to build things in sequence . 
so , i was able to stone one adulterer . 
this is a view taken along the summit ridge . 
make it go away . make it go away . &quot; 
the bad news is they &apos;re rocket fuels . 
i set up a studio and i tried to get published . 
the second , i believe , is political correctness . 
and we stitch them together like medieval monks . 
so , what do i discover when i look at artworks ? 
and the irony is that they don &apos;t need to be . 
they &apos;re even more shocked by what he says . 
they wouldn &apos;t experience restraints as we would . &quot; 
it is something to be greatly optimistic about . 
there are three obvious ways of doing this . 
anyway , please join me in teaching these values . 
take out those who say they save too little . 
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran . 
i keep thinking about these kids with no arms . 
i believe a story there has to be told . 
there &apos;s a jewish saying that i love . 
when you pump in air in a bicycle , you use a bit of this . 
there &apos;s all these different interventions but they have different kinds of effectiveness . 
hi . so , this chap here , he thinks he can tell you the future . 
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &apos;m saying . 
and this blew his mind . literally . he checked into a sanitarium . 
and the gag is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market . 
but he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; because it &apos;s there . &quot; 
and then 24 months from now , people will be able to take a ride into space . 
it does hurt . and we reinforce the storyline , right ? 
then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth . 
but i want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate . 
well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles . 
and anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic . 
it didn &apos;t come because you put some incredibly smart person in charge . 
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lined up i guess . 
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know . 
so , the house is no longer suitable for invasion . 
the dutch are good also , but the italians are good . 
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause . 
as we start , you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady . 
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life . 
&quot; no , my daughter , she &apos;s coming in the buick . 
the system was designed to augment human intelligence , it was called . 
here &apos;s a design for distilling water using sunlight . 
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question . 
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year . 
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about . 
and we even know something about the way the brain does this . 
they set the prices , and i don &apos;t even know . 
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat . 
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing . 
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot; 
look , the world has changed from analog to digital . 
and when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll . 
and then it started , there was no turning back after that . 
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird . 
they are fused together , so you can &apos;t separate them . 
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can . 
they are 7,000 every year -- people coming for the first time . 
i can see my work as a job . i do it for money . 
it &apos;s a very logical plan , but it was not always like this . 
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ? 
so this is the signature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns . 
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the sheep &apos;s cleverness . 
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex . 
nor do i think we are by ourselves , actually going to solve the problem . 
we explore for three reasons , the weakest of which is curiosity . 
it &apos;s been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years . 
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technological revolution . 
and for the first time ever in three generations , his children would go to school . 
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there . 
well , the problem is that we &apos;ve got very complicated forces in the climate system . 
i &apos;m really scared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it . 
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet . 
on the computer , when you move your mouse , that arrow moves around . 
it is always the same , never the same , endlessly fascinating . 
and i really love hearing about all these species at the bottom of the sea . 
and this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology . 
okay , so the politics of oil are very moral in the united states . 
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are . 
mr. teszler hired 16 men : eight white , eight black . 
really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . really , not very much . 
the girls , to my horror , averted their gaze . 
so if i do something that hurts you , i feel that pain . 
i put reverse thrust and i try and pull gently down . 
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here . 
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today . 
when i do make some money , i &apos;ll have one machined for myself . 
and it is really not suited for the future that we &apos;re moving into . 
and they &apos;re investing in telecoms , shopping malls . 
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds . 
then i would go up and deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge . 
and that &apos;s a backdoor which will take over your computer . 
i think that crows can be trained to do other things . 
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong . 
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice cartoons . 
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens . 
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep . 
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail . 
the full videos are online if you are interested . 
we actually think the future &apos;s going to be event-driven . 
so again , the unexpected which is also the raw . 
move your eyes around , blink , maybe close one eye . 
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing . 
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of yours . 
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt . 
that &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit . 
it just seems like it &apos;s not sexy and elegant , it &apos;s hidden . 
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on . 
and so then they &apos;re all sold in the store . this is near the planks . 
so i &apos;m going to show you , we &apos;re going to play just for a second . 
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it . 
and he asked that particular person , what do crows and fish have in common ? 
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet . 
so the robot is obviously capable of executing any curve trajectory . 
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &apos;t . 
you could say , well , it doesn &apos;t look very different from when he started . 
wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go . 
well , one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome . 
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change . 
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want . 
but the real projections for those ones , i would like to give it like this . 
it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a bajillion windmills . 
in fact , we anticipated that star formation shouldn &apos;t proceed in that environment . 
politicians in a big , complex , sophisticated i.t. project ? 
she was smiling . she did not understand why i was so worried . 
i don &apos;t have to worry about the bridge to where at my age . 
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world . 
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being . 
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are catching up . 
there isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural creature . 
this is probably the skyline that most of you know about doha . 
and that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively . 
no ceo , no firm responsible , singly , for building it . 
and then like karajan . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ? 
and i know what you &apos;re all thinking about are dodgeball teams . 
or you can go back and change the height . now , skill . 
these are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way . 
so the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe . 
an example , a great example , is the risk of smoking . 
and suddenly , without realizing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently . 
she said she is &quot; silly , nice and friendly . &quot; 
the architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb . 
throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction . 
clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans . 
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these . 
it &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to arise . 
and they say , &quot; oh , yeah . constant acceleration . 
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it . 
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; . 
it can &apos;t afford to doubt the person who tends the child . 
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now . 
of course , you and i know that coke is the better choice . 
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad apples . 
reaching success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas . 
finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . 
it &apos;s not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors . 
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monitored by the culture . 
so as we flew by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ? 
and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this . 
in our first year , the first net went off the line in october of 2003 . 
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about . 
so let me show you , and i &apos;m going to start with the standard method first . 
and the danger is that they can cause roughly what &apos;s a pandemic . 
and collectively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off . 
when other people see my tattoo , for the most part they like how it looks . 
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &apos;t really even find the bird . 
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change . 
each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it . 
no , i was quiet . i was quiet because i had not come for truth . 
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile . 
let &apos;s go back a few years in time and see what happened back then . 
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go . 
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i &apos;ve just mentioned . 
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall . 
and in two hours , after their backs were broke , they were changed . 
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground . 
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated . 
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there . 
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy . 
the first peak , obviously , is the limb hitting the load cell . 
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ? 
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it . 
most of the educational games that are out there today are really flashcards . 
with a thousand juliáns working together , mexico would be a very different country . 
so this is our last number , and we &apos;ll feature nat on piano . 
there are important distributional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think . 
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off . 
they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is . 
animation , software , moviemaking software , they have it all . 
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality . 
that horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot . 
everything except randomness . she did not believe in randomness . 
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open . 
the defining factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resourcefulness . 
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country . 
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot; 
we stopped irrigating our soil , as much as we could . 
it &apos;s our own pond . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot; 
and the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting . 
maybe these people are right . maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing . 
no slouching , no pants hanging down , none of that stuff . 
if you &apos;re wired to make deals , you make deals . 
and i swam through the night and i swam through the next day . 
because it told me , by god , one person got it . 
and this is the first theater project i worked on . 
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning . 
thank you so much.as : well , thank you . thank you . thank you , chris . 
in fact , he was probably six inches taller than me , and she was about this tall . 
and interestingly , from an identity standpoint , what does it mean to have a disability ? 
now that &apos;s not quite true . there &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through sweating . 
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent . 
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true . 
but it all starts with seeds in classrooms , in my place , which looks like this . 
we &apos;re now , instead of shipping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet . 
and in ways both big and small , the narrative of the victim shapes the way we see women . 
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no reference to jerry garcia . 
so collaborative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-located or distant and distinct , is always important . 
they &apos;ll be cooking , cleaning , buying things , shopping , building . but they aren &apos;t here . 
so , that &apos;s a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on . 
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it . 
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go . 
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children . 
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , most important , behavior . 
well , how many bottles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ? 
is this a story-of-the-year , a story-of-the-decade or something more ? 
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discussing them . 
actually , that &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online . 
i feel that i have dignity that i have lost for so many years . &quot; 
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you . 
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way . 
right . i go to the deli ; i &apos;m sick ; i need to buy some medicine . 
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative . 
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure . 
it &apos;s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it . 
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being . 
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think . 
you find elephants , rhinos , monkeys , pigs , etc . 
my father , who i &apos;ve been talking about , died of aids in 1999 . 
that &apos;s banned now , and that &apos;ll be good news for the sharks . 
what &apos;s more , they are able to walk upright for long distances . 
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &quot; 
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s penguin shit . &quot; 
it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dirty jobs &quot; is . 
so the donors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade . 
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; mentalese . &quot; 
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s shaping us . 
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time . 
what was actually killing us wasn &apos;t the muslims , wasn &apos;t the arabs . 
i mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ? 
as humans , we are social , we are empathic , and that &apos;s great . 
and now the shore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad . 
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not . 
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neutral to talk . 
now , she chose c , g , b , a , e . 
and that &apos;s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning . 
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has guns . 
number three : the handouts you give are not your presentation . 
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down . 
we &apos;re using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table . 
well i built a fusion reactor when i was 14 years old . 
and this is test on some lip balms that we have over here . 
the cause of our troubles is actually the complexity that science has given us . 
this is wushan , one of the largest cities that was relocated . 
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally . 
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here . 
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers . 
and to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something . 
i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight . 
i learned they are the sinew which hold the force together . 
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things . 
it says a lot about her peers who elected her . 
she was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines . 
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i just heard . 
packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off . 
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean . 
that is all there is to it . apple has patented this . 
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ? 
the real social innovation i want to talk about involves charity . 
so it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer . 
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a euro or a yen . 
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot; 
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do . 
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more overtly erotic . 
it &apos;s solvable , not by being a democrat , not by being a republican . 
who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . nobody . 
the first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair . 
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues . 
but it visited jupiter , saturn , uranus and neptune . 
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that cafeteria , man . 
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , secure , healthy and durable . 
you see the skaters often trick in this direction . the obstacles are easier . 
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw gyeonghoeru . 
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s ridiculous , steve . what a dumb idea . 
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny . 
so it has neither the resources , nor the incentives , to hook up many other users . 
and so a hammer , when we grab a hammer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grabbing . 
rw : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing . 
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything . 
i don &apos;t want them to be teased at school by the other students . &quot; 
one of them , from anthropology , is the study of human universals . 
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software . 
he reached down . he pulled a lever . and the chair sank down . 
once upon a time , the world was a big , dysfunctional family . 
&quot; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot; 
engineer : absolutely . interviewer : you thought , &quot; oh , bother . &quot; 
now as anthropologists , we know that every culture has an origin story . 
but we don &apos;t know where , since we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern . 
this was bad ! man , i was -- i cough . i was sick . 
he would try to visualize it , guided by a small number of simple principles . 
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it . 
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society . 
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology . 
we were in the desert , in wadi rum , in a small jeep . 
from the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the western culture . 
as it copies itself , once in every billion rungs , there tends to be an error . 
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clogging up a light socket . 
the laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful . 
this is work done by quentin lindsey who &apos;s a graduate student . 
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly . 
i &apos;ll give you some astounding things that have happened as we started this . 
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen . 
today , in sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines . 
went on , and eventually decided to devote myself , full time , to that . 
the fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all . 
and leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine . 
the miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is . 
the people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality . 
suzanne , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random . 
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer . 
we &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-pitched tones . 
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me . 
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong . 
every holiday i had as a young boy was in a national park . 
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldier with this gun . 
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in shock . 
meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything . 
so , that &apos;s 20 micrometers across , that pollen grain there . 
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ? 
i don &apos;t mean that we evolved to join gigantic organized religions . 
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the horizon ? 
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach at a college of arts . 
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to . 
and yes , you also interact using natural gestures , both hands , etc . 
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s underground . 
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression . 
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start riding on scooters . 
if you listen to the way black youth today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot; 
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass . 
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &apos;ve got to get on with it . 
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children . 
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real breakthrough . 
but because i had no family to inquire about me , they could do anything to me . 
and you all know what it is . you don &apos;t need to have a disability to know that . 
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great difficulty . 
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a magician &apos;s trick . 
dl : so anyway , we &apos;re running out of time , so i &apos;ll just get to it . 
now that you &apos;re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common . 
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else . 
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right . 
and a social movement is comprised , in my view , it &apos;s comprised of four main characteristics . 
this is when we &apos;re like , &quot; ok , we &apos;re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &quot; 
it &apos;s not only something that supports trees , but something that connects people and countries together . 
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people . 
my mother comes out , and he asks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough . 
boone , i really , really appreciate you coming here , engaging in this conversation . 
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a specialist in . 
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like . 
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison . 
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot; 
so i can say , with some certainty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot; 
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed . 
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars . 
and one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you out here . &quot; 
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more . 
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paralyzed by fear . 
the only two requirements were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english . 
bullying is a disease . prejudice is a disease . violence is a disease . 
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of binary , you need a device . 
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is failing . &quot; 
but the problem is , you get hungry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off . 
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more . 
i &apos;m like , &quot; get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know . 
el nino comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s rhythmic . 
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this . 
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago . 
and to make them really stereotypical , let &apos;s make them both white guys . 
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet . 
well for the sake of time , i want to focus on just three strategies . 
blue cheese , ranch , oil and vinegar , thousand islands and house . 
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do . 
we believe that the stakes are high , but that the returns will be even greater . 
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascinates me . 
the animal could be a cow , lamb , or even something more exotic . 
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math . 
so , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak . 
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win . 
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended . 
that &apos;s the inter-monsoon , the time when the monsoon changes . 
one is people need a guarantee they won &apos;t be evicted . 
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today . 
&apos;okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me . 
look at this young bean that is moving to catch the light every time . 
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal . 
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them . 
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart . 
and what &apos;s even more disturbing is what &apos;s happening with younger boys . 
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circuitry does change . 
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected . 
business does not profit from causing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense . 
skill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure . 
so again , what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment , at first rate . 
yemen , civil war . united arab emirate , money which was quite equally and well used . 
and so it was simply astonishing to me to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides . 
it allows us to do the art , the biotechnology , the software and all those magic things . 
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a widget like this . &quot; 
and , you know , once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected , including us . 
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom . 
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them . 
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty . 
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything . 
that &apos;s a great answer . rebecca saxe , thank you very much . that was fantastic . 
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appears that what i &apos;m stating is true . 
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ? 
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure . 
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-library . 
and , incidentally , i call her the eleanor roosevelt of the right . 
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound . 
you have to say , well , blackness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suffer just for that . 
you &apos;re too keen . you &apos;re too keen . no . hang on . hang on . 
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of hype about our power to control biology . 
and i want you to release that negative energy by shaking it from side to side . 
what you see , if you see the title called &quot; pm &apos;s car held . &quot; 
we need an exercise . we need a framework to learn how to be more mindful . 
that &apos;s what he was doing , propping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work . 
so if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 . 
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it . 
and if you go on the diagonal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth . 
so the question is , how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia ? 
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a protocell . 
it &apos;s a customer , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s participating . 
and because i have a 15-year-old , all i do is cook and cook and cook . 
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it . 
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers . 
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in greenland in winter , mars is still not very far . 
uncle gets drunk , doesn &apos;t use condom . come back , start again . &quot; 
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be . 
no buttons to push , no triggers to pull , just me and the game . 
and i &apos;m not kidding , i just think we should just say that and move forward . 
i mean , literally , her hometown is called whitesville , west virginia . 
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there . 
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons . 
but for every disaster we had , the marathon found ways to bring people together . 
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news . 
and there are three ways , i think , that these massive-passive data can be used . 
and i was so excited -- first person i &apos;d ever see outside of ebbets field . 
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup . 
some of the teenagers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot . 
it &apos;s not that i think that spoken word poetry is the ideal art form . 
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nurses or doctors to help us out . 
i mean , today , singapore is a first world country and ghana is not . 
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity . 
and you have people who guide those computers to do their clerical jobs . 
if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done . 
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music . 
i have a solution that requires neither machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas . 
he &apos;s like , &quot; no , miss , i &apos;m not going . 
so we have portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces . 
and i met julius the last week that i was living in kibera . 
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ? 
this peers , inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm . 
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &apos;t been to . 
and we &apos;ve looked at everything : more aids cases , flu , etc . 
dinosaur evolution proceeded at a stately pace , an order of magnitude slower on any way you want to measure it . 
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious . 
that sort of overall sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concerns . 
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some gunpowder for them . 
we &apos;ve chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor , a nurse and a mentor mother . 
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat . 
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it . 
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood . 
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture . 
as i come out of the water , solly arrives at a deep section , a channel between us . 
and this is ongoing work , but dermatologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a dermatologist . 
liver cells , nerve cells , pancreatic cells -- we still can &apos;t grow them even today . 
zk : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target . 
now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynamite , frankly . 
i used to be a fan of bach . i used to play it on the guitar , you know . 
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preserve darkness . 
well , thank you . i mean , it &apos;s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies . 
then , a few years afterwards , using permacultural strategies , we green that part of the desert . 
we got madd chadd , lil &apos; c , kid david and j smooth . 
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly positioned . 
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an acquired language . 
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to become individuals and find their differences amongst themselves . 
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back . 
i mean , just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again . 
it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control . 
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science . 
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost . 
so , we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else . 
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people . 
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanzees about five million years ago . 
workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot; 
and reading that book made me reexamine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that . 
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to climb up the wall in jerky fashion . 
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just rituals that give us meaning . &quot; 
and , in fact , the first pioneering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available . 
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes . 
we are , should be , morally committed to being the healer of the world . 
and in there he said that cultures tend to swing between one of two perspectives . 
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stamp collect there . 
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ? 
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organism and then applying it . 
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at . 
but if they were together planting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity . 
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came . 
but you notice , i &apos;ve cheated , because i &apos;ve only gone up to &apos; 94 . 
because , you see , dna is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make . 
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensory apparatus , and so on . 
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my anger . 
you could still buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything because it had been silenced . 
you choose . it &apos;s your bakery , your street , your country -- not mine . &quot; 
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of money for it , no government money . 
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at stickybot . 
and there are two important messages , or two lessons , to take from that reality . 
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say dangerously powerful , insight . 
i thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse . 
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries . 
no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair . &quot; 
and that gives me hope because people are not purely selfish . 
hospice was for people who were dying , and terence wasn &apos;t dying . 
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it . 
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here . 
leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us . 
but there were times when i wanted to remind both sides that this was fiction . 
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hyun-sook &apos;s village , and she was gone . 
if you don &apos;t want to be deceived , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hungry for ? 
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , excellent . 
it &apos;s a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desks isn &apos;t going to help . 
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimism . 
and the philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant . 
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot; 
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ? 
and &quot; ha-ha , there is a picture and here is i. and what does it matter ? &quot; 
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos . 
she has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health . 
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radiator , which is curved . 
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot; 
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s racked with famine and drought . 
and this material that &apos;s deposited either starts as a liquid form or a material powder form . 
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem . 
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us secure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel secure . 
and rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be something that a bobcat needs . 
so , think of the three settings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migration , office . 
interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join . 
they &apos;re basically attempts at figuring out what people should do instead of rush hour car driving . 
and i think when you look at the animal kingdom , that is one of the most remarkable things . 
now this is a -- it &apos;s a little test i encourage you to try out at a party . 
this is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields . 
it isn &apos;t when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society . 
seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in america is consumed in animal husbandry . 
it &apos;s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market . 
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years . 
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads . 
it &apos;s horrible . it &apos;s a proof of our failing to save them in the wild . 
well , we collect data from satellites , from airplanes , from ground vehicles , from people . 
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud . 
you have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on pdrs , personal recorders . 
but i put that slide in there because i &apos;m often asked if there are any animals in the project . 
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared . 
and mark twain , who knew all about typesetting , really was smitten by this machine . 
it has these strong , heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth . 
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa ? 
but i thought , no , no , experiment with resins , experiment with polymers . 
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting . 
you can tweet your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line . 
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government . 
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indicate hydrocephalus . 
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ticket to financial freedom . 
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do . 
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you . 
let me just say , look , my job is a privilege because we &apos;re in a special time . 
my student pranav , who &apos;s really , like i said , the genius behind this . 
i &apos;ve had some that could and wouldn &apos;t , and i &apos;ve had some that would and couldn &apos;t . 
we do have one unintentional dancer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you . 
when i look around this tedxamsterdam venue , i see a very special audience . 
it &apos;s very fashionable to talk about human trafficking , in this fantastic a-c hall . 
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive . 
so if we start to think exponentially , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us . 
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spreading . 
for them , nations , countries , boundaries , borders still matter a great deal , and often violently . 
sb : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years . 
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a pregnancy test . 
bl : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found . 
it will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope . 
and lastly , the only portrait of a male that leonardo painted , &quot; the musician . &quot; 
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by suzuki . 
it persists for months and oftentimes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease . 
so i can see everything that romo sees , and i get a robot &apos;s-eye-view of the world . 
and , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , national marine sanctuaries . 
the sensor would have to be inexpensive , rapid , simple , sensitive , selective , and minimally invasive . 
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being . 
and then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute . 
so really , retranslating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtually pollution-free . 
but what we lose , i think , is an accurate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context . 
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play drums on . 
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essence of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible . 
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the maintenance of chinese civilization . 
this one , a little sketchy going backwards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot . 
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it immensely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere . 
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been offered to her , was her life . 
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pairs of people connected to each other . 
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fife accent . 
you see , the indians also had a river that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead . 
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named barack obama . 
if you do that tomorrow , i &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead . 
tourist : i think that people are very frustrated that they &apos;re not able to get closer to see what &apos;s going on . 
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology . 
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize . 
and there &apos;re only 102 because people got bored collecting them : there are just new ones every year . 
and later this year , the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years . 
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more orphans . 
so there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal . 
can you feel their anger , their fear , their rage at what has happened in their country ? 
i said we can shorten the column , we can spread it out to cover the couch . 
we had full-page advertisements , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this canal came . 
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an aesthetic ; it &apos;s really a truth . 
they typed it into google , translated it into italian , went back into italian google . 
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white rhinoceros . 
so let &apos;s start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer . 
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it . 
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different mindset , a totally different society . 
here we see people that feel &quot; slipping , &quot; &quot; nauseous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot; 
and they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them . 
bl : i &apos;m going to fast-forward to the decision point because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time . 
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang . 
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper . 
we are left with this missing space of increased deaths the further north you go . 
even the ones that believed they were getting better matched the controls exactly . exactly . 
we went to africa , sudan , sierra leone , liberia , kenya . 
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor . 
and he said , &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did . 
but not worrying about rent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love . 
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out . 
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; big sister wong , &quot; washburn , wong , same difference . 
and so before we could start imaging archimedes , we had to take this book apart . 
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder . 
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might . 
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too . 
we are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king . 
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under . 
it &apos;s what i strive for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection . 
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs . 
and it &apos;s based on a few thousand people we &apos;ve sampled from , you know , a handful of populations around the world . 
in short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago . 
this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware , and that &apos;s the notions that we have with biology . 
michael free at path says you have to figure out who will &quot; choose , use and pay the dues &quot; for a product like this . 
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circumstances : living with intent . 
women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pull-ups . 
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when i attempt to explain consciousness . 
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volume . 
we can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals . 
just have a quick look . and what we need to realize is that every 300 base pairs in your dna , you &apos;re a little bit different . 
i mean , the great difficulty in europe is if you &apos;re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time . 
and people who are teachers out here , whoever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about . 
and again , when you can take kids from backgrounds as diverse as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment . 
well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body . 
except that they &apos;re not as rich as ours , because they don &apos;t have a cerebral cortex like we do . 
and we can then see the result of such mutations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example . 
you didn &apos;t break it . it &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful . 
we are already laced up as if we &apos;re in a fiber optic corset , if you like . 
the man , his name was mahmoud , and the child , whose name was rafi , left . 
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &apos;t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have . 
there &apos;s this thing , this militarization of the world , and it &apos;s centered right in the united states . 
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s gdp in 1960 , around the time of independence for many african states . 
and she saw that if there is no inflammation then the scan is a uniform gray . 
so i went to russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; soviet union . 
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexible , inside yourself . 
and if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size , but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger . 
but there are also countries here like guatemala , like papua new guinea , like yemen and afghanistan . 
the hare itself , the animal -- not a cat , not a dog , a hare -- why a hare ? 
these corals can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have surfing scars to prove that . 
books have saved the introverted , timid child that i was -- that i once was . 
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot; 
the silver lining is , i think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting . 
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it . 
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ... 
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habitats . 
and here is this , then , young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid . 
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the holy grail of our industry . 
well on september 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio . 
and if anybody asks why you &apos;re carrying a condom , you can just say you like the design . 
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games . 
first of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy . 
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabilizing the micro economy . 
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through . 
it was the honey in the water that made it sweet , it was the oil that made it sick . 
it &apos;s just a collection of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way . 
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot; 
elon musk , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted . 
that is great , that means we &apos;re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion talents together . 
we love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them . 
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher receives them , they paste them on the school . 
this is probably the saddest sound i &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organism , human or other . 
you can lean back , but the camera will change its perspective depending on which way you &apos;re looking . 
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day . 
we already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours . 
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &apos;s what writing is . 
and that allows me to check my timer discretely , here , without bending my elbow . 
they have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles , and the site &apos;s in red . 
it is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized , bottom-up structure of the internet . 
not just because it rang earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because i made a little calculation . 
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem . 
so , practice compassion , read the charter , disseminate it and develop it within yourself . 
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right . 
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world . 
people with colored hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters . 
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to rattle . 
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software . 
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consciously identify as african . 
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with built-in speaking systems . 
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain biking or reading a book or playing a game . 
and then i think the other point is that indians today are far more comfortable with globalization . 
now , fashion designers have the broadest palette imaginable in this creative industry . 
i walk around and encourage them , &quot; come on , come on ! &quot; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two . 
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement . 
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &apos;s got an opinion . 
now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little naive . 
silk . put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section . 
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the aisle , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool . 
and so , on a micro level , there &apos;s a real role for this combination of investment and philanthropy . 
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects . 
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question . 
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different . 
this is a mouse created by charles vacanti of the university of massachusetts . 
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 . 
it has rocked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consume music . 
and you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know . 
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty . 
we were talking about , my friends in brazil , how we scale up this model in china and brazil . 
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures . 
and i &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small . 
and again , it &apos;s fully interactive , so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here . 
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of wheat , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 stages . 
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about . 
and meanwhile , i was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band , the dresden dolls . 
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from russia . 
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teaches you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things . 
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology . 
and what we &apos;re looking at is the presence of the gas methane , ch4 , in the atmosphere of mars . 
a culture which is top-down , owned , where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost . 
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans mating ? &quot; 
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have strived to understand cancer . 
now shared car services are also springing up around the world , and these efforts , i think , are great . 
but structures designed to connect , rather than divide mutually dependent circles , rather than isolating triangles . 
and the latest thing that i &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &apos;t know what it is yet . 
he knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to . 
and what &apos;d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the hamptons . 
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer behave like this . 
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back . 
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now . 
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &apos;s not enough . 
you look at the patients , you can drill in all the controls , you can look at them , you can ask them . 
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that . 
in fact , even back during the ancients , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagram like this . 
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a godless person . 
and it &apos;s too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough . 
that &apos;s actually the actual printer right now , and that &apos;s been printing this kidney structure that you see here . 
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data . 
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account -- it &apos;s not , but ... 
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was struggling , fighting addiction and a gripping depression . 
and so this is basically a song about loops , but not the kind of loops that i make up here . 
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil . 
bruno bowden , who &apos;s here , did that , broke the world record.em : congratulations . 
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quantified boundaries , as suggested by this analysis . 
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be . 
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet you know in your gut that it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;ll tell you why . 
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that frustrate you when you try to swat the fly . 
specifically , it targets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong allies of the united states . 
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ireland , where i was teaching , and has since spread . 
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples . 
as far as colleges go , there &apos;s about 350 colleges around the world teaching video game courses . 
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappear . &quot; 
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much remains to be discovered . 
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t . 
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology . 
so , we thought we would exploit this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks . 
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s october 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot; 
if you look at the registry , actually , a lot of the registered things in the e.u . 
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now . 
i believe the concept of global citizenship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across continents . 
and your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , nails -- everything is made of collagen . 
and so one of the tools that we can use to sample the oceans is acoustics , or sound waves . 
right now , as bill mcdonough has pointed out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences . 
and this man , archie cochrane , is a prisoner of war and a doctor , and he has a problem . 
and in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form . 
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better . 
so a person that &apos;s interacting with the robot understands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its motions . 
i was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story . 
it &apos;s not fiction , it &apos;s not story tales , it &apos;s not make-believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science . 
i &apos;ll show you a computer model made by iain couzin , a researcher at oxford , that shows how swarms work . 
this is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that . 
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman . 
we paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question . 
so i &apos;m going to briefly discuss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions underway . 
so , there &apos;s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shouts , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot; 
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have . 
so just to conclude , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them . 
and we did a survey that backs up the fact that , you know , 45 percent of people in this very crucial demographic in the u.s . 
and later , between 100 and 50,000 years ago or so , went out of africa to colonize the rest of the world . 
and then , what population of the earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on , and be for 2050 , 2100 , 2150 ? 
more than how a phenomenon works , theoretical physicists are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works . 
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot; 
and then , because the juveniles are in my collection , i cut them open and look inside . 
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music remains . 
and moms grab their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t stare ! &quot; 
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are . 
our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot; 
a wise person knows how to improvise , as luke did when he re-washed the floor . 
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are monet prints . 
so this is the footage he photographed , and it was pretty moving and pretty awe-inspiring . 
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it . 
but i also learned very soon thereafter that jesus also said , and i &apos;m paraphrasing , the poor would always be with us . 
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and apparently without injury , without problems . 
you don &apos;t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wiring changes in the way it functions . 
you &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it . 
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to refer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now . 
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside . 
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &quot; 
like saddam , like mugabe , like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions . 
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult . 
so when i got this email from dr. geiger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history . 
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bowery poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier . 
what that might mean for cultural movements all over this moment , the &quot; me , we &quot; seems incredibly prescient totally important . 
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive . 
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have . 
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a rapid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ? 
this is &quot; 6,500 yards , &quot; after corot . &quot; 9,000 yards , &quot; after gerhard richter . 
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an output and a state in the middle . 
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a producer . 
the careful testing , retesting , design , are going to open up vistas of understanding , complexities , difficult things . 
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english . 
there is a side that fights , and there is a side that keeps the schools and the factories and the hospitals open . 
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge trademark violation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .

a victor in a thousand contests , three great civil rights laws , medicare , aid to education . 
so preparedness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for granted aren &apos;t there .

and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be on the wavelength of your audience . 
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &apos;t exist . 
other examples you can see here are from latvia , lithuania , estonia -- the central european countries . 
so let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it . 
i &apos;m addicted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my grip on reality , i still crave more . 
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media ? 
so particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions . 
so if we had to design a perfect cochlear implant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music transmission . 
we are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fathers , uncles , cousins , all around us . 
now , i was a little scared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with . 
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . prices of goods go up , inflation is affected . 
he proved it was prime with nothing more than a quill , ink , paper and his mind . 
the sharp , crisp outlines of this formation make it the best one for finding shapes in . 
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet . 
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need . 
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise . 
it &apos;s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful commonality between design , business and the world . 
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location . 
thinking it through , i realized that all those attributes must be changed to move t to the denominator . 
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower right-hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have . 
and these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . one adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other . 
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an asterisk , and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world . 
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ? 
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have severe , profound if you will , implications to her family . 
there are rich lesters , poor lesters , black lesters , white lesters , not many women lesters , but put that to the side for one second .

he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and i was frankie p. toronto . 
a three-and-a-half foot thing , beautiful skull , predator , meat-eater , a two-legged animal . 
we &apos;ve all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur when an old disease rears its head , like anthrax . 
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about typography , even though we worked with those animals not so successfully . 
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way . 
generally , what you see in green is not desertifying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth . 
one of the founders went to switzerland , saw it implemented someplace , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool . 
and we have had a speaker who said that very thing , and swallowed a sword right after that , which was quite dramatic . 
what you see here on this toughness graph is the higher the black dot is on the graph , the higher the toughness . 
in other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires . 
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your bearings when you &apos;re in midair . 
and she says , &quot; they want to go . &quot; and i said , &quot; honey , no they don &apos;t want to go . this is the middle passage . 
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanzees , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habitats . 
and darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hunch . 
but the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood . 
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners . 
you start looking at how the global plane flights move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat . 
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &apos;t do : don &apos;t hit ; don &apos;t bite ; don &apos;t swear . 
now i don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that excess energy . 
but nevertheless , there &apos;s no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people . 
well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one . 
how does that happen ? we want dylan to be able to do that , and using this mantra of motion , dylan actually can do that . 
and a lot of the time the question of parenthood is , what do we validate in our children , and what do we cure in them ? 
and this is a mockup that is in salt lake city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale . 
i want to write about a tornado that comes into our house and blows all the windows out and ruins all the furniture and kills everybody . &quot; 
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation . 
i like music , and i like banjos , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot; 
what is real is separateness , and at some point in early babyhood , the idea of self starts to form . 
thanks . thank you . now , juggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space , play with rhythm . 
it doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go . 
it doesn &apos;t matter what kind of sediment you &apos;re using to grind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .

when you open up the front door , this is what you &apos;re looking at . it &apos;s pretty simple . it &apos;s a hole in the ground .

that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long lifespan , until we have the daf-2 mutant . 
i estimated that , just today , across the world , we spent about 106 average world lifetimes teaching people how to calculate by hand . 
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father . 
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop peeing on herself because so many grown soldiers had shoved themselves inside her . 
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard academic , joseph nye , a friend of mine . 
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see darkness . 
someone who has done something like this , however mediocre and throwaway , has tried something , has put something forward in public . 
and it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mute . 
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get confused and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay . 
any society can adopt these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achieved after 1500 -- only faster . 
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect . 
it &apos;s almost as if that stimulus , you , you &apos;re not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives . 
the problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey . 
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s the big arrow -- and the penis on the right . the hand hovering . 
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agreed to get lied to . 
if the lhc finds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e8 theory . 
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important . 
entropy means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of decline and decay , the arch . 
this man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body . 
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other . 
and what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes . 
let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love . 
found that when he looked at a playground out of a window into which he had been confined , he felt something different . 
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manufactured . 
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remembers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remembering people . 
and also triumph , this sense of transcendence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot; 
and i thought , no , it &apos;s a very intimate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father . 
and the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place . 
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife . 
now , if you take a game like warcraft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great box-opening effort . 
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in delivering services , sometimes where none exist , than ushahidi . 
i think popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in . 
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all be the same : like , the chairs you &apos;re sitting in would all be the same dimension . 
so , two months later , i went into tibet , and i started interviewing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do . 
we are limited with distances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time . 
and on one particular day , the campers were jumping through inner tubes , they were diving through inner tubes . and i thought this would be great fun . 
100 bucks . that &apos;s the price-improvement curve that -- we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way , i &apos;ll grant you that . 
it &apos;s what is meant by overcoming the horror that we feel when we are under threat of our enemies , and beginning to appreciate the other . 
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother . 
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant , but you are allowed to bribe a deputy . 
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right . 
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong . 
this little boy will never step outside of the sacred fields that surround the men &apos;s hut for all that time , until he begins his journey of initiation . 
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a sponsor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a crass version of our founding story . 
and then she clarified . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it sucks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it . 
the yellow-green area is the fluids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also antibodies , sugars , hormones , that kind of thing . 
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body . 
try to imagine a gorilla performing the same maneuver , and you can see that , compared with gorilla , we are halfway to being shaped like a fish . 
they acquire the sensibility of truth because they repeat over and over again , and they ossify and calcify , and they become real . 
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavioral tracking that i have not navigated to , but are following me . 
we can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves . 
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so dense and so hot , light can &apos;t escape . 
flickr is a photo-sharing service that allows people to take photos , upload them , share them over the web and so forth . 
it &apos;s achievable . we should do it economically , we should do it morally , and we should do it for quality of life . 
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them . 
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bilingual enough to help us translate . 
but we do have the potential to overcome disease and poverty , and i &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will . 
i need to understand the mass of the object i &apos;m claiming is a black hole , and what its schwarzschild radius is . 
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game extends and continues even when you &apos;re gone . 
von neumann , and a logician , and a mathematician from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it . 
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to tears , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years . 
it took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces . 
the future states that there is no time other than the collapsation of that sensation of the mirror of the memories in which we are living . 
my friend ronald gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t . 
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; oops , dumpster . &quot; &quot; oops &quot; this . &quot; oops , warped . &quot; 
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , besides jobs , is electricity . 
and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see tonight . so . 
i remember we cried profusely when the little goats we played with in the summer became biriani . 
&quot; um , abed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot; 
so she &apos;s even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid . 
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle . 
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick , just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle . 
when i was visiting my terminally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ? 
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that . 
so the first idea i had , initially , was just to go the federal and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot; 
germany , my own country , in the year 2000 , featured in the lower quadrant , below average performance , large social disparities . 
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my legacy , part of my personal record ? 
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children . 
it &apos;s just unbelievable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that . 
most of the people who lived here either lived in coastal villages , fishing , or were nomads who roamed around with the environment trying to find water . 
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control , and this is also with only four leds . 
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &apos;d been too much on google lately . 
and certainly , neither crick or i were chemists , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , francis knew wilkins . 
it was historical . could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ? 
politics and politicians will only succeed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be . 
these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region . 
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it . 
i mean , can you picture a politician standing up in britain and saying , &quot; gdp fell two percent this year . good news ! 
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four . 
hella jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hilarious . 
the problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms . 
the position of women , how closely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world . 
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronomical . 
and if you ask what kind of situation is conducive to people defining people as enemies , it &apos;s a zero-sum situation . 
the first is selecting a feedstock , preferably something that &apos;s regional , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing . 
so it &apos;s small trades by small people , but it &apos;s very informed , safe , convenient , low-overhead and immediate . 
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hardship due to this . 
india , mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use . 
everything is not predictable : the stock market is , at least for me , not predictable , but most complicated negotiations are predictable . 
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ? 
having explained those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer . 
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense . 
i think that the &quot; now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it &apos;s up . &quot; 
one is a supermarket standard : white bread , pre-packaged , which i &apos;m told is called a wonderbread . 
it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it . 
there are now dozens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &apos;re drinking the expensive stuff , it tastes better to you . 
because they thought that if you are having a telescope , you are an astronomer so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescope . 
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the younger kids . 
rb : ah , that was quite fun . that was a wonderful car-boat in which -- oh , that car that we -- actually we -- it was a tedster event there , i think . 
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of homework , homework , lecture , homework , lecture , and then you have a snapshot exam . 
so when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing . 
you &apos;re looking at the outside shell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evolving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evolving very fast . 
for those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual , it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself . 
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a sketch , which we pulled out of the archive recently . 
but i think this is the frustration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &apos;re talking about . 
surely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and forgive me , but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents . 
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , observing every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then placing that within this . 
now i &apos;m not a lawyer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot; 
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right balloon team to build the balloon that would do this job . 
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an undefended heart . 
there are very few doctors and , quite frankly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics . 
and the fire that burned in me on day three through six of chemo is the fire that is burning in the forests of the world . 
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10.3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries . 
though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass . 
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion , and that is the commodity booms . 
we do like to consume , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share . 
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same concern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transplant it here . 
see , mr. hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem . 
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile . 
and frankie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place . 
can you imagine saying to your coach , &quot; uh , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot; 
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e. it could be i. it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ? 
but , most importantly , while i was traveling , i taught children cartooning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spontaneous . 
in 1976 , for example , government and industry insisted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of gdp could never go down . 
because the thing is , we are so chauvinistic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen . 
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone . 
this idea is nicely captured by this quote : &quot; things without all remedy should be without regard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot; 
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later . 
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very prosperous , and thus use a lot of stuff . 
these three systems are coming together , allowing people to share resources without sacrificing their lifestyles , or their cherished personal freedoms . 
yet we dither , taking no action to deflect the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes . &quot; 
now i bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &apos;t even heard of , i &apos;m absolutely sure . 
so what i did is i took all of the interviews where i saw worthiness , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those . 
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these interactions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world . 
let me say parenthetically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a potentially controversial statement . 
what they remember is , of course , the great triumph , that the brits were beaten , and we won , and that the country was born . 
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures . 
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deepest secret that maybe millions of people are empowered to help improve it . 
we need to spend more time appreciating what already exists , and less time agonizing over what else we can do . 
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-organization that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see . 
that story perfectly captures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make . 
and my relationship to especially human-made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit . 
i believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point . 
and i remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy . 
and she said things that really shocked me about her vagina -- that it was dried-up and finished and dead -- and i was kind of shocked . 
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in . 
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ? 
that &apos;s a picture i took of my bronx borough president , addressing my kids in his house , not the jailhouse , making them feel a part of it . 
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ? 
you see banks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world . 
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a vc pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return . 
we began the project with an interim report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been collected on the subject by many , many researchers . 
i believe , if kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile . 
so this means that , with each euro he invested , he was able to move 26 euros of market value through the chain of ownership relations . 
it &apos;s time again to talk about &quot; inconvenient truth , &quot; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about . 
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjoys it when mister putin turns off the gas tap , because my budget goes up . 
we know that &apos;s wrong , because we conducted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geography mattered more than institutions . 
and i started across the hall in north carolina , because i thought it was probably a canaletto , and would have all that in detail . 
you &apos;ve seen people take beneficial technological advances , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about tonight , and twist them into something corrupting . 
but the people who fabricated that solar cooker are women , illiterate women , who actually fabricate the most sophisticated solar cooker . 
and i think galileo summed up , very nicely , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us . 
and of course , by the time you get to the average workplace , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-it notes . it &apos;s pretty barren . 
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no flirtation , no movies , no games , no fantasy and , and , and . 
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe . 
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a printer , a color printer , it prints colors . that &apos;s what color printers do . 
i was a student in the &apos; 60s , a time of social upheaval and questioning , and on a personal level , an awakening sense of idealism . 
wrong . identical twins , or any siblings , who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together . 
we really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight . 
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others . 
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions . 
they turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work . 
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy . 
katrina showed us that we cannot completely depend on government to have readiness in hand , to be capable of handling things . 
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ? 
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as banking trojans , which will steal money from your online banking accounts when you do online banking , or keyloggers . 
electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn . 
the first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution . 
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost unacceptable to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future . 
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and assertive and dominant , but not very stress reactive , the person who &apos;s laid back . 
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villages and go into cities , is because they are always gravitating towards increased choices and possibilities . 
and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren &apos;t being capitalized on . 
these were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died . 
so within a few years , in the late 1800s , early 1900s , all of a sudden , the barber surgeon had given way to the physician who was trying to make a diagnosis . 
when they &apos;re monitoring your clickstream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time figuring out your age , your gender and your income . 
we think doodling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a preemptive measure to stop you from losing focus . 
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come . 
and so the next time you meet someone , a stranger , one request : understand that you live in the subjective truth , and so does he . 
it &apos;s transparent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual constructional processes that make it . 
i &apos;ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction : a perfectly wonderful addiction when it &apos;s going well , and a perfectly horrible addiction when it &apos;s going poorly . 
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case . 
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense . 
i kept thinking of beds and red cheeks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &apos;s thinking about ? 
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening . 
i &apos;d like to show you thing called snout , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appears as if it &apos;s continually surprised to see you . 
i &apos;d been traveling in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2,180 years old and knew that i had to go visit it . 
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict enhanced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level . 
so it &apos;s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away digitally so you &apos;re flying through the air . 
well , the colorado on a typical day in the 1950s , this is just , you know , not a flood , not a drought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this . 
and not only is it empowering to the communities , but really importantly , this information stays in the community where it is needed to formulate long-term health polices . 
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot; 
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real kobe , and one of them is wolfgang puck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles . 
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cyber weapons . 
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreciation of my body , the way an abusive parent can sometimes have a moment of kindness . 
imagine you &apos;re driving in a fog . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avoiding the accident , or getting into an accident . 
we need relative figures that are connected to other data so that we can see a fuller picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective . 
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to . 
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape . 
whether you &apos;re an artist , a technologist , a lawyer or a fan , the handling of copyright directly impacts your life . 
so i thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us . 
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives . 
i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality . 
but i believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &apos;t really know about you . 
it &apos;ll be a free download -- thank you , craig mundie -- and it &apos;ll be available at the website worldwidetelescope.org , which is something new . 
so we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment . 
studies for the structure of the roof , which demands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it translucent , how to make it glowing , how to make it not capricious . 
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other . 
and then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means . 
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope . 
a world telegraphy center -- imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly . 
and it &apos;s this combination , this cumulative technology , that intrigues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world . 
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &apos;t make vaccine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story . 
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet &apos;s falling , the greater the stopping force . 
it means that , if you have t.b. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from t.b. secondary infections and so on . 
but one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment . they use echolocation . 
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole . 
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , engaged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit puberty , or whatever it is . 
it &apos;s really too boring whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets . 
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever . 
and the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance . 
i had my own heart scare years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kidney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot; 
we &apos;re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly positively pitch-black world . 
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world . 
and , yeah , we can look back in retrospect and say , yeah , ha-ha , you know -- it &apos;s all microfilm . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future . 
but much more , to get advices , to give your comments , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground . 
but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency . 
so what i &apos;m proposing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a menu of choices . 
it burned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other rocket fuels i had tried , that all had sulfur in them . 
if you &apos;ve ever seen an electron microscope picture , you &apos;ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated . 
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still searching for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better . 
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense . 
in a region famous for the soft , porous loess plateau soil , there lived until recently an estimated 40 million people in these houses underground . 
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less humane , but it &apos;s less effective than using methods that connect people with people , that rebuild . 
and you might think it &apos;s just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year . 
he &apos;s all murky . there is little kids leaning on his leg , little ghosts flying around . we gotta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentlemen . 
their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was shattered . 
it &apos;s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &apos;s the only way to release the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you . 
at the same time , while i was interviewing the red brigades , i also discovered that their life was not ruled by politics or ideology , but actually was ruled by economics . 
in the netherlands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pig , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pigs . 
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreciate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between competing goods . 
the dystopia that worries me is a universe in which a few geniuses invent google and its ilk and the rest of us are employed giving them massages . 
and i remember , natasha didn &apos;t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time barricading the room . 
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot; 
because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ? 
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman receiving a chinese flag because her loved one has died in america in the coal uprising . 
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nub of the question , which is how we think about time itself . 
and what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents threw them out on the street . 
the person on the assembly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to drill an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on . 
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighbor , very quickly , just as quickly as they could . 
so when people &apos;s symptoms go away , they tend to recur , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gratitude , what are the positive emotions . 
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads nodding , people who say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot; 
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody . 
the poem that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a domestic point of etiquette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , processing . 
i think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs and bring it to that kind of shoebox of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing . 
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures , and they say , &quot; i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot; 
jim collins , the author of &quot; good to great , &quot; told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preserve the core , they stimulate progress . 
today , we use a single feedstock , petroleum , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you . 
the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria , which led to this compartmentalized scheme , which we found out after the competition would not work at all . 
has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting chest pains , shortness of breath , sweating ? 
he wrote this to his love , maud gonne , and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him . 
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veterans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance . 
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from nathan , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail . 
world population , pc placements , the archive of all the medical literature , moore &apos;s law , the old way of sequencing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff . 
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passive consumers to creators , to highly enabled collaborators . 
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names . 
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s supermassive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no finite size . 
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic , magical powers that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the deceased . 
the phrase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a postdoc or you &apos;re a professor , a 38-year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an empiricist . 
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relevance to humans that we really need to , even from a selfish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past . 
you can see the lispenard meadows draining down through here , through what is tribeca now , and the beaches that come up from the battery , all the way to 42nd st . 
and the species in the soil go to work basically chewing through those roots , decomposing them -- the earthworms , the fungi , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil . 
and of course consider images that can be sensory patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or auditory images , as you are having now in relation to my words . 
i &apos;m fascinated with the idea of what happens when you merge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to reprogram biology , in the future , away from disease and aging . 
these projects are so -- paypal , solarcity , tesla , spacex , they &apos;re so spectacularly different , they &apos;re such ambitious projects at scale . 
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot; 
i worked in other parts of new zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in fiordland , where this sea pen colony was found . 
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; disabled &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet . 
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point . 
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference . 
they go out and point a telescope at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , estimate how far away they are , and plot them up . 
and all i can really do is hope , not to policymakers or politicians , because as much as i &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &apos;t delude myself . 
if i could reveal anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reveal something that we &apos;ve forgotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names . 
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the underlying reason that it &apos;s been politically unacceptable to talk about this . 
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the infidelity of a parent or spouse , money inherited ? 
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the lagoon somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea . 
and sometimes it takes a wake-up call , doesn &apos;t it , to alert us to the fact that we &apos;re hurrying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life . 
and , according to jesus , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love yourself , you must love the lord your god with all your heart , mind and soul , and your neighbor as yourself . &quot; 
your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspire them to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &apos;t imagine . 
and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture , on the elements that make up the broader scheme , the buildings themselves , and start guiding us . 
whenever it comes up to the midpoint , it pauses , it carefully scans the odor interface as if it was sniffing out its environment , and then it turns around . 
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular route that i had taken , the remoter the school was , the worse its results seemed to be . 
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a mcluhan sense , an external stomach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise . 
we want to be able to build technological artifacts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological artifacts , like people and whales and trees . 
i think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on , in this regard . 
and within jewish teachings , the rabbinic teachings , we have hillel , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself . 
and visiting some pretty incredible places , places like mongolia , cambodia , new guinea , south africa , tanzania twice -- i was here a month ago . 
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t reverse themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why i talk about us all going through this together . 
and if you lose where you are in your biosphere , or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting with where you are in the biosphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath . 
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data , terabytes of data and extracting the relevant information . 
at a reception in their courtyard , i noticed that they had a fountain because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain . 
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the skill of negotiating , and they learn the skill of finding opportunities as well . 
and these doctors or these masters , these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition , refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies . 
we take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it . 
the culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that &apos;s been sliced , diced , layered and , god knows , distributed and sold . 
then monarchy had seen off its big challenger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment , just as capitalism has seen off socialism . 
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it . 
or the op-ed page , where if they knew the editor -- had been to school with him , slept with his wife -- they could write an article for the op-ed page . 
you start with some water , pour in some nanotubes , add antibodies , mix it up , take some paper , dip it , dry it , and you can detect cancer . 
but what &apos;s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work output is of the type that can be easily shared digitally -- a picture , a music file , software . 
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better . 
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media . 
it &apos;s really maneuverable . you have a hand-held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceleration , braking , go in reverse if you like , also have braking . 
so i want you to reimagine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations . 
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by postulating an agent that is even more complex , thereby simply compounding the problem . 
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make . 
so , one of our passions in our company , and now one of my personal passions , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , accessible and affordable . 
and it turned out that most people wouldn &apos;t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &apos;d come back . and my dad had a third jar of pills . 
whichever way they want to do it , of their own volition , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new zealand . 
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion . 
there is another thing with those traits that we so easily observe in each other that i think is worthwhile to consider , and that is that , in a very literal sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies . 
commerce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundamentally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other . 
so , &quot; related searches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this feature into our adsense ads , called &quot; related searches . &quot; 
it turned out , as i think you could see in aimee &apos;s capabilities and attitudes , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable . 
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society . 
so , you know , when a school bus is blown up and we &apos;ve never seen this before , our general tendency is to orient towards that which is new and novel is activated . 
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanzees or other living creatures , is this sophisticated spoken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here . 
while we initially heralded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that regard . 
the first embrace is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us . 
in investigating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives . 
think about it : what other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &apos;t seek to reinvent its business model on a regular basis ? 
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done . 
and it excites me now to meet people who are hikers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people i never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on . 
and i said , first of all , let me do the calculation on that compound , bottom right , which is related to coumarin , but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule . 
that if you live in the best climate , in san diego in the united states , or in the shittiest climate , in buffalo , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place . 
now you may not think of hotmail as being miraculous , but for me it was miraculous , because i noticed , just as i was wrestling with this problem , i was working in sub-saharan africa mostly at the time . 
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen . 
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot; 
and as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve doubled in size , you &apos;ll see them split , and that &apos;s how they reproduce and the population grows . 
and as these dark clouds were circling me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow . 
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that . 
you see , the thing is obesity and diet-related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters . 
that &apos;s understandable , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own classrooms , and they pick the lessons they want to submit , a lot of them will be eager to participate . 
and recently , i was in easter island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly mysterious place , because no matter where you go in easter island , you &apos;re struck by these statues , called the moai . 
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jumping around and not focusing on one topic . &quot; 
and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad &apos;s idiosyncrasies , his little tics , the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen . 
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; on the couch ; &quot; sit , &quot; tummy-rub ; &quot; sit , &quot; look , i throw a tennis ball ; &quot; sit , &quot; say hello to that other dog . 
you bring your water , you bring your soap , i wash the clothes for you . charge 50 paisa , one rupee for you per lot , and a new business model can emerge . 
i mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t belong on your face . 
strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that i need right now , that enables me to find the sources of intimacy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now . 
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circumstances of my life . 
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contributing enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contributing to landfill . 
the planning function and policy function stays with the ministry ; the delivery of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- churches , ngos , local communities , whatever works . 
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that holds us back is access to information . 
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institutional context , which told us what in communism ? 
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t contaminated , a world that isn &apos;t polluted . 
but if i was to say that they &apos;re both examples of alternative or new forms of currency in a hyperconnected , data-driven global economy , you &apos;d probably think i was a little bit bonkers . 
you &apos;re going down into our lobby , go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium . 
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even anger , disgust and pain . 
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria . 
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robotics competitions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it . 
here is the chart of over 43 people helping to steer the robot that could not steer and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another . 
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our waking moments in it , the challenge is to live in two streams of time that are parallel and almost simultaneous . 
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it wasn &apos;t ... 
through haiti rewired , through build change , architecture for humanity , aidg , there is the possibility to reach out to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons across the country and create a movement of proper building . 
they are the result of a young team of very talented people : physical therapists , neurobiologists , neurosurgeons , engineers of all kinds , who have achieved together what would have been impossible by single individuals . 
so i &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which enables us to capture what is symmetry . 
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fantasy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before . 
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappears , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger . 
is it the exposure ? we have professors from mit , berkeley , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas , experiments , much beyond the classroom . 
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about . 
there &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of dubious value , which you create by changing the way people look at things . 
and we were grateful that i was able to get pregnant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child . 
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphite , which is soft and dark . 
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said , &quot; products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives . &quot; 
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in congress , yelling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adopt their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar . 
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipulations , you put it on a little device , the device filters out the blood cells , lets the serum go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there . 
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &apos;t get a cat . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ? 
it can be a school of design in jerusalem that tries to find a better way to design gas masks for people , because , as you know , israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies . 
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death penalty lawyers have understood that the earlier you intervene in a case , the greater the likelihood that you &apos;re going to save your client &apos;s life . 
there are two kinds of errors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are errors in estimating the odds that they &apos;re going to succeed , and errors in estimating the value of their own success . 
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the governmental decisions , discussions of the council of ministers , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the council discussions took place . 
rosa mexicano restaurant , where he transports us to the shores of acapulco , up on the upper west side , with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go , like that . 
it was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us . 
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quantum mechanics , electromagnetism , all together in one package , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see . 
another thing that information technology lets us do is start figuring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monitoring , the amount we &apos;re actually using . 
hopefully , really understand the customer at its heart , where the customer is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places . 
and this bone is peppered , as you can see , with the light shining through the skull with cavities , the sinuses , which warm and moisten the air we breathe . 
i &apos;ve traveled , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horrific to think what we do to girls in the world . 
now that was cheating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be amy the hurt five year-old little sister , but amy the special unicorn . 
and these are two anecdotes -- one was in cambodia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no telephone , but has broadband internet now . 
huntington &apos;s kitchen . huntington , where i made this program , you know , we &apos;ve got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change . 
the people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals . 
we had fashion designers , installation artists , models , we had makeup artists , jewelry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my wedding an art installation . 
we couldn &apos;t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , springy legs , you could make it as maneuverable as any that &apos;s ever been built . 
instead , all the major threats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems . 
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation . 
evolution &apos;s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bible says , you know , god created all these species , cats are cats , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &apos;t change . 
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flowers in a garden and then , basically , index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t . 
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the branding , it all becomes deeply connected . 
&quot; i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies , man-made forests , limestone caves and hey , even a huge python . &quot; 
that as we explore these strings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may uncover a completely new class of life that , like beijerinck , will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology . 
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a sharp decline of ecosystem functions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term , in our forests , land and biodiversity . 
i tell kids when they struggle through some uphill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles and raise your head and look around and see how the vista around you grows . 
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the sheep flow and go where we wanted them to go . 
and they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements , and they would be really irritated and wouldn &apos;t see what we were up to . 
in fact , she indicated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude from the members of the extended family , but she said , &quot; even god will smile , and when god smiles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot; 
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 41 -- when she was five , was overheard by me to say to a friend of hers , if it doesn &apos;t bleed when you cut it , my daddy doesn &apos;t understand it . 
so the management of electrolux took our pile , our list of incentives , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &quot; wow , this is the most generous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here . 
we &apos;re going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to compose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the courtyard , the civic square and how to really make use of this property . 
so first , if you are the type , like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you . 
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back . 
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophistication of the modern world is through politics , and sadly you can have humane moral principles , you can classify , you can use logic on abstractions , and if you &apos;re ignorant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics . 
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a loaner , but i did go into the manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which i used . 
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . &quot; 
anyway , so i &apos;m proposing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is required where schools don &apos;t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason . 
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-monkey , and the fun is , the super-monkey we are today , is at half of the story . 
and we have plenty of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &apos;s tricky , because as we put through all these toxic materials that we disgorge , we will never be able to recover that . 
i believe that there are new , hidden tensions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people inhabit in their daily life : schools , hospitals , workplaces , factories , offices , etc . 
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of focusing on loss or limitation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives . 
so the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comments , all the views , who &apos;s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comments . 
i used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable . 
and what bayes &apos; rule says is that i should multiply the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the ellipses , and that &apos;s my belief . 
but if we rearrange this formula quickly , we can get to acceleration equals force over mass , which means that for a larger particle -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction . 
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient , where they see the video and they &apos;re being videoed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don &apos;t . 
newton aduaka : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cinema is for me , and where i &apos;m coming from in terms of cinema . 
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that cloning is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation . 
and this exhibition is about the work of designers that help us be more elastic , and also of designers that really work on this elasticity as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists . 
doug hofstadter wonders , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smarter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it . 
so we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lonely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed . 
if we can break down this sort of divide , this unease , this tension , this sense that we &apos;re not fundamentally collaborating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions . 
it all began when two scientists , fred grassle and jesse ausubel , met in woods hole , massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute . 
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the incentive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in inside-the-box education systems in rural communities . 
so what i &apos;m proposing is , just as we require reading , writing , arithmetic , american history , so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world -- about their history , about their creeds , about their texts , their music , their symbolisms , their prohibitions , their requirements . 
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her drunkenly stumbling , falling , sprawling , skirt hiked , eyes veined red , swollen with tears , her shame , her dishonor . 
dean ornish shares new research that shows how adopting healthy lifestyle habits can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live healthier , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase . 
rob forbes , the founder of design within reach , shows a gallery of snapshots that inform his way of seeing the world . charming juxtapositions , found art , urban patterns -- this slideshow will open your eyes to the world around you . 
i didn &apos;t have an exact address , but i knew his name , abed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15,000 , kfar kara , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this holy city , he broke my neck . 
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an asymmetric threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization . 
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this pace , over my whole career , maybe i &apos;m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs . 
you decode what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string . 
not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy , but there has been , historically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the cosmos is , and how people think about the society that they live in . 
the adoption process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , sealed deal , an industrious , utilitarian solution : the government , the farmer , the adopting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the crop . 
but since we ate all the oysters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plankton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is unheard of for plankton . 
so you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps , but you think about amazon , you look at the trust barometer that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments . 
so it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , &quot; world 3.0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no-border effect benchmark , which would imply internationalization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent . 
summertime and the living is easy fish are jumping and the cotton is high oh , your daddy &apos;s rich and your ma is good-looking so hush little baby don &apos;t you cry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed . 
and now let me become less sentimental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contributing productively into the economy . 
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that we &apos;re rational individuals who respond in straightforward ways to incentives , and it &apos;s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assumptions of physics to measure how human behavior is . 
and like a living organism , you tear it open , it bleeds its molten blood , rises up to heal that wound from the asthenosphere , hardens , forms new tissue and moves laterally . 
but that ... process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every authority that you &apos;ve ever heard of i -- sometimes you do that , if you &apos;re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it . 
and for the following 25 years , living in italy , living in america , i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who &apos;d pay for it -- this sense , this aesthetic feeling , for the experience revolving around a designed object . 
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes , of these triggers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling . 
and when you think about the economy through these two different lenses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the stakes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ruin everything . 
there &apos;s this large , consolidated farming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 1980 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass consolidation , mass exodus of small farmers in this country . 
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , behaves like continuous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can behave like a continuous fluid . 
so two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . and we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ? 
when the paper burned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &quot; mashelkar , like this , if you do not diffuse your energies , if you focus your energies , you can achieve anything in the world . &quot; 
you &apos;re seeing an animation that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this technique -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is . 
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &apos;m playing with -- when i first saw an imax film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there &apos;s a real resonance between what i &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photographer . &quot; 
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the narcos , the carteles , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the latter are only providing a service to the former . 
what &apos;s actually happening is that what were previously localized parochialisms , individual or groupings of extremists who were isolated from one another , have become interconnected in a globalized way and have thus become , or are becoming , mainstream . 
and with the same dogged determination that my father had bred into me since i was such a child -- he taught me how to sail , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the shore , and i couldn &apos;t see the sails , and i couldn &apos;t see the destination . 
and it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical , activist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their preferences , their choices and their voices to encourage that outcome . 
but when you see the map , and you see our state of michigan -- it &apos;s legal to fire someone for being gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , that it &apos;s legal to remove someone from their home because they &apos;re gay , lesbian , bisexual or transgendered , then you realize that this whole conversation about marriage equality is not about stripping someone &apos;s rights away , it &apos;s about granting them the rights that &#91; have &#93; already been stated . 
she said , &quot; it &apos;s over . &quot; when i finished that night , she called him and left a message -- true story -- at the top of the world trade center where he worked , saying , &quot; honey , i love you , i just want you to know i want to marry you . it was stupid of me . &quot; she was asleep , because it was 3 a.m. for us , when he called her back from the top and said , &quot; honey , i can &apos;t tell you what this means . &quot; 
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they empowered me to save myself , and crucially , they helped me to understand something which i &apos;d always suspected : that my voices were a meaningful response to traumatic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my enemies but a source of insight into solvable emotional problems . 
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator -- since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood . 
so , i &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &apos;s the difference in somebody &apos;s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 100-dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them . 
this is a call so that every single thing we love about mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , el grito , the day of the dead , san miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be mexican -- doesn &apos;t disappear from this world . 
and i started in our medical university , karolinska institute , an undergraduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swedish college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-test when they came . 
as a matter of fact , we think reaching 100 percent is very doable , even before the 2015 timeframe . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been solid , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , latin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently visiting south africa . 
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 60k , then 50k , then 40k , a job where you &apos;re getting a salary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a salary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ? 
and it &apos;s my feeling and it &apos;s my urging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communicators of this , but also as the ones who carry that burden of carrying the children , bearing the children , we hold most of the buying power in the household , is that it &apos;s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of tyrone and other scientists around the world . 
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in australia . and that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure . 
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement -- whether it &apos;s china , greece , the hindu civilization , or the mayas , or egyptians -- what we know about them is really about their ecstasies , not about their everyday life . 
between australia and here , right , they &apos;ve got summer and we &apos;ve got winter , and what -- does the earth kind of rush towards the sun at night , and then rush back again ? i mean , it &apos;s a very strange thing going on , and we hold these two models in our head , of what &apos;s right and what isn &apos;t right , and we do that , as human beings , in all sorts of fields . 
there are three trucks there . you &apos;re going to instinctively go for the white truck , because that &apos;s the top truck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &quot; oh , he can &apos;t see that truck , so he must mean me to move the blue truck , &quot; which is the top truck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make errors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial . 
and i organize it . and , well , it &apos;s also a bit different because an architect versus , let &apos;s say , a dance company finally is a negotiation between one &apos;s private world , one &apos;s conceptual world , the world of ideas , the world of aspirations , of inventions , with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations , the naysayers . 
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are violated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordinariness of it , is so devastating to one &apos;s soul that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that . 
in those days there was still countryside close to the city , farms , cornfields , cows ; even not far from our building with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway you could find tracts with hills and trees you could pretend were mountains and forests . 
the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders , the one in five of us who struggle in some way , you find that there &apos;s a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired , but there are some predictable patterns , and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders . 
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as jill &#91; bolte &#93; taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through . 
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ? 
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like . 
she then assigned these works racial identities , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob colescott , african-american artist ; leon golub , a white artist . 
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right . 
and the good thing about perceiving ultraviolet is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to sunbathe , because ultraviolet is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to perceive things that we cannot perceive . 
fifty percent will have onset by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hypertension -- most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality . 
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding , coming back into the studio , doing the brainstorming and design visualization to come up with concepts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyping them , figuring out if they are going to work and refining that . 
now , the particular species of dragonfly i want to talk about is this one , because most dragonflies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far . 
and it will be sub-orbital . and the reason it has to be sub-orbital is , there is not solutions for adequate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died . 
so lula , he &apos;s full of problems , full of contradictions , but one of the things that he &apos;s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue into a whole new way of global collaboration . 
samuel pisar , an auschwitz survivor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot; 
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; i unloaded the dishwasher , &quot; but he really listens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work . 
and we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with isaf , we sat down with nato , we sat down with the u.k. government .
