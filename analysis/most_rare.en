automo@@ tive retro@@ fu@@ tur@@ ism is one of my speci@@ al@@ ties .
there was natural sele@@ ction for the evolution of ligh@@ tly pig@@ mented skin .
and out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few do@@ zen pa@@ pers on a few do@@ zen processes or molecules .
now , here is another nai@@ ve adverti@@ sing man &apos;s question again .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 ballo@@ ons , and some really sad sou@@ l holding one ballo@@ on .

six weeks , city versus city .
more generally , i want to tell you something about behavi@@ oral economics .
so , un@@ fol@@ ded it &apos;s about 300 lin@@ ear feet .
some of the reasons for this are not really very contro@@ versi@@ al .

i don &apos;t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
this was on del@@ ta 7@@ 19 going from j@@ f@@ k to san francisco .
lying has evolutionary value to us as a species .
even people were playing it for ter@@ min@@ al diagno@@ ses like als .
a second part of the brain is called the dor@@ sal stream .
we have a serious com@@ pres@@ sion of the cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um happening out there .
or as some econom@@ ists call it , present bi@@ as .
they got more cal@@ ories over the course of a diver@@ si@@ fied me@@ al .
in response , he gave me an even more cour@@ te@@ ous version of the same explan@@ ation .
80 to 90 percent of their time was spent on five things .

these sorts of ideas don &apos;t really have any v@@ ali@@ di@@ ty , that you can &apos;t trust the scientists .
with human@@ i@@ zed technology we can monit@@ or the quality of your sleep cy@@ cles .
so the electro@@ magnetic and we@@ ak forces are described by this pattern of partic@@ le char@@ ges in two-@@ dimensional space .
my works also turned auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal .

this is about a hidden corner of the labor market .
this is cher@@ y@@ l ang from sing@@ apo@@ re .
here is the critical difference between these : l@@ ol@@ cat@@ s is commun@@ al value .
instead of using electrical mot@@ ors , electro@@ mechan@@ ical actu@@ ators , we &apos;re using com@@ pres@@ sed air .
that &apos;s about 4@@ 3 percent of all the preg@@ nan@@ cies .
you cle@@ an@@ ed up my room .
so , with the mit media lab , for quite a while now , we &apos;ve been enga@@ ged in a field called active music .
and i thought , &quot; well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
cell mem@@ bran@@ es are phosp@@ hor@@ us-@@ based : these are called phosp@@ ho@@ li@@ pi@@ ds .

i once -- this was years ago -- i saw ted ken@@ ne@@ dy and dan qua@@ yle meet in the well of the sen@@ ate .
this is where we conc@@ ei@@ ve of ra@@ pe and cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties as inevi@@ t@@ abilities .
nigeria got its indepen@@ dence in 1960 .
that comes from the last name of one of sch@@ um@@ ann &apos;s female friends .

so it runs frequ@@ ently , the entire hospital , just on a gener@@ ator .
this last project is also of components .
the b@@ b@@ c got their first wind of the chinese qua@@ ke from twitter .
we &apos;ve suff@@ ered pro@@ se@@ cu@@ tion ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
we also find that people are more a@@ verse to losing than they are happy to gain .
char@@ it@@ able giving has rema@@ ined stuck , in the u.s. , at two percent of g@@ dp ever since we started meas@@ uring it in the 197@@ 0s .
suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
notice how few barri@@ ers there are to movement across all of the oceans compared to land .
our whole practice depen@@ ds on computing .
i have just been talking to the president of si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one .

low-@@ income people spend a lot more than a thousand on lot@@ ter@@ ies .
is it thing one or thing two ? what is it ?

here are sh@@ ri@@ mp bo@@ ats emplo@@ yed .
this is especially important for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted children too .
there &apos;s just some bits that are band@@ -@@ ta@@ iled pi@@ ge@@ on .
we &apos;ve also found an un@@ inten@@ ded con@@ sequence .
the shu@@ ttle is co@@ sting a billion dollars a laun@@ ch .
they &apos;d never made one from previ@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ recor@@ ded materials .
but den@@ g xi@@ a@@ op@@ ing instin@@ c@@ tively understood the importance of off@@ ering choices to his people .
i close with this song -- it &apos;s a children &apos;s song -- because we are all children at the table of mama e@@ ternal .
he had a pretty low-@@ wa@@ ge job .
by the way , we had half the budget of the other western nations .
in the american mid@@ west , farmers used to load grain onto bar@@ ges and send it u@@ pri@@ ver to the chicago market .
but 30 percent is not a pass .
they didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff higher up the pyrami@@ d .
and perhaps one ar@@ che@@ ologist becomes an inst@@ ant cele@@ bri@@ ty when she disco@@ vers -- bu@@ ried in the h@@ ills somewhere in north america -- massive ver@@ sions of these same sym@@ b@@ ols .
but then , you can see the same kind of wh@@ im@@ sy applied to people .
that was our h@@ f radio anten@@ na .
and using indi@@ go , make it anti-@@ micro@@ bi@@ al .
in fact , this galaxy and every other galaxy appe@@ ars to be em@@ bed@@ ded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter .
min@@ d@@ less@@ ly taking the first small step .
they are very different from us in body form .
within nine years , we had multi@@ pli@@ ed that 1,@@ 9@@ 8@@ 2 times into 10@@ 8 million dollars after all expen@@ ses for aids services .
it could run a me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m on it .
it &apos;s forced child labor and all of those products probably end their lives in a du@@ mp like this one in man@@ il@@ a .
in this particular case a section will be de@@ vot@@ ed to information design .
and this is also true of some remote oce@@ an@@ ic is@@ lands .
unfortunately , o@@ bes@@ ity &apos;s not only an american problem .
in the setting of pro@@ state cancer , up to 60 percent of men after pro@@ state cancer surgery may have ur@@ in@@ ary in@@ contin@@ ence and er@@ ec@@ ti@@ le dis@@ function .
it took about 10 years to put this project together .
but there &apos;s another way of thinking about p@@ ts@@ d .
on the right are some tu@@ gs from a company called a@@ eth@@ on in pit@@ ts@@ burgh .
but it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison .
i want to point out a few other ex@@ cep@@ tional people in this picture .
you see this enormous ine@@ qu@@ ity in china , in the mid@@ st of fast economic growth .
but not all patients on the transp@@ l@@ ant wait list are so fortun@@ ate .
and i fac@@ ed a whole new set of challenges .
so both of these objects have six symme@@ tries .
so with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um goal &apos;s target of hal@@ ving the number of people without access to safe drin@@ king water .
the survi@@ vor@@ s that do get through produce this world of cro@@ co@@ di@@ le-@@ like creatures .
this person is likely to have some form of schizophren@@ ia .
how do we make stable societies ? lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty .
that comes out at five to 10 tons daily per square mile in cities .
it &apos;s caused by fast process@@ ing of tox@@ ic cas@@ sa@@ va ro@@ ot in fam@@ ine situation .
but there are other hol@@ low organs that have ad@@ ded complexity to it .
we &apos;ll have family break@@ fast . we &apos;ll meet for a bed@@ time s@@ n@@ ack .
even in stories on gen@@ der@@ -@@ based violence , men get an over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming majority of print space and air@@ time .
which is not a level of service i have ever off@@ ered to my stanford students .
almost nobody gets out of love alive .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l sha@@ de : hi , ai@@ mee . ai@@ mee mul@@ lin@@ s : hi .
from the small@@ est wis@@ p of air to the powerful forces of nature &apos;s stor@@ ms .
so below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
it &apos;s a bunch of crazy pic@@ to@@ graphic not@@ ation .
first , the west is rapi@@ dly losing its influence in the world .
i have come from a place of inten@@ se dar@@ k@@ ness .
the artist m@@ .@@ c. es@@ cher explo@@ ited that in some of his wonderful prin@@ ts .
another shape is made for cancer .
i think of the great indian mathemati@@ cian , ra@@ manu@@ j@@ an .
this ep@@ iso@@ de led to my first hospit@@ alization in america .
they don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satis@@ fied .
and yet , all the press is focused on that .
you &apos;ve got to see this -- bi@@ ble boot camp .
play a sport with a friend at lun@@ ch@@ time .
and a small group of thou@@ ght@@ ful people changed that bay .
by that compar@@ ison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
those events led to a domin@@ o effect that has yet to end .
but u@@ v@@ b and u@@ va especially , came in un@@ im@@ pe@@ ded .
he was le@@ an@@ ing on his other arm .
and i was having dinner with this guy called ti@@ mo@@ thy ch@@ an .
and she started , the women &apos;s health initiative .
and we currently have access to el@@ even language pa@@ irs .
so i was ar@@ re@@ sted quite early in stal@@ in &apos;s pur@@ ges , and spent 16 months in a russi@@ an prison .
i have become more and more un@@ comfortable with this perception of god over the years .
this is fi@@ li@@ pp@@ in@@ o li@@ pp@@ i &apos;s 15@@ 4@@ 3 portra@@ it of sa@@ int apo@@ ll@@ on@@ ia .
but sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that .
let &apos;s do a ro@@ tation by a third of a turn an@@ tic@@ lo@@ ck@@ wise , and refle@@ ct in the line through x .
this was a mother &apos;s day gift .
because this is about 10 dollars of addi@@ tional hard@@ ware if you already have a n@@ inten@@ do wi@@ i .
they &apos;re talking about sla@@ very in 18@@ 60 .
and anyway , my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time .
they always make a tri@@ ang@@ ular roof .
these are parts being prin@@ ted with multi-@@ material properties .
your parents were pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful people .
it is only if one is visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red or blind that the process is inter@@ rup@@ ted .
so here &apos;s our c@@ un@@ ning experim@@ enter .
just in the last two days , we got the new temperature recor@@ ds in janu@@ ary .
and in this extraordinary setting , the co@@ st@@ um@@ es were like ac@@ tors and ac@@ tr@@ esses , or living sculp@@ tures .
and so previous studies had only focused on microscop@@ y .
can@@ aries used to be used as kind of bio@@ sensor@@ s in min@@ es .
the next part i want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
it looked more like this when it was all wra@@ pped up -- not quite so pretty .
so i now have this sort of restaurant men@@ u vis@@ iting of art g@@ aller@@ ies .
you &apos;re 3@@ 7 percent better at sal@@ es .
without insects , there &apos;d be no flo@@ wer@@ ing plants .
it &apos;s 196@@ 8 , and we &apos;re pretty much co@@ vering asia .
but ho@@ ma@@ ge to sing@@ apo@@ re .
it de@@ pri@@ ves eu@@ than@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
and to the right hand side of us was this great k@@ hum@@ b@@ u gl@@ aci@@ er .
the concept centers on something called the no@@ or st@@ ones .
the universe can spon@@ tane@@ ously create itself out of nothing .
fund@@ raising was not an easy task .
18@@ 5@@ 8 in china was the vic@@ tory in the op@@ ium war by the british forces .
constru@@ cted each plan@@ k of gold .
s@@ j : you &apos;re over a c@@ up .
it can only occu@@ r if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen , and is totally satur@@ ated with hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de -- enough , for instance , to come out of solution .
i &apos;m going to read a few stri@@ ps .
now mathemati@@ cians have ans@@ wer@@ ed that question .
there &apos;s so many things we can do with this right now .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
but just two weeks before that , the u.s. sen@@ ate re@@ f@@ used to even debate the ban@@ ning of b@@ pa in babies &apos; bot@@ tles and si@@ pp@@ y cu@@ ps .
the bad news is , this is a se@@ mi@@ -@@ sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble run by drug car@@ tel@@ s .
you could be attac@@ ked by white blood cells in the ar@@ ter@@ ies .
my mother was an admini@@ str@@ ator .
they had to sus@@ p@@ end fun@@ ctions at 8 : 30 .
and of course : a ham@@ mo@@ ck for your after@@ noon na@@ p that stre@@ t@@ ches across your cu@@ bi@@ cle .
this is a very ligh@@ t@@ weight suit . it wei@@ gh@@ s about 15 pounds .
california em@@ its only seven percent of u.s. co2 emissions .
one of them , i call my mi@@ ma@@ w &apos;s test .
everything is just fine under these circum@@ stances .
we tend to form clu@@ sters based on simil@@ ar@@ ity , and then we produce stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ es about other clu@@ sters of people .
he finally st@@ ops the run@@ away stage .
so it &apos;s got hy@@ bri@@ d drive .
these human@@ -@@ in@@ duced alter@@ ations occu@@ p@@ ying over@@ all less than a milli@@ on@@ th of the el@@ ap@@ sed lifetime and seem@@ ingly oc@@ curr@@ ing with run@@ away speed ?
but in america you have to explain . what are clu@@ bs ?
and then you can take the little piano circu@@ it off the pen@@ cil .
i had exten@@ sive and life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening in@@ ju@@ ries .
you have to design an artificial foot for such conditions .
and to my ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ment , they bac@@ ked me 100 percent .
i don &apos;t own a gu@@ es@@ thou@@ se .
my experience , however , in the islam@@ ic world is very different .
there &apos;s no exchange of ideas between them .
but i pre@@ fer for maybe 40 to 50 .
all the sculp@@ tures move by mechan@@ ical means .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
these risks directly affect the sustain@@ ability of this nation and its continu@@ ity .
this is steve wo@@ z@@ ni@@ ak . where does he learn about computers ?
he &apos;s a 7@@ 8 year-old farmer who suff@@ ered from -- how should i say it ? -- it &apos;s called pain in the bu@@ tt .
j@@ s : cu@@ ts itself .
now , here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of .
and so that gest@@ ure of my mother &apos;s continu@@ es through many generations .
but i have to tell you a funny story .
but the great change came , of course , with glob@@ alization and der@@ e@@ gu@@ lation .
and make the transition to more efficient vehi@@ cles go faster .
there &apos;s nothing in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally swe@@ et about hon@@ ey .
but looking at gold@@ man sa@@ chs &apos; work -- we had the famous bri@@ c report .
and you can build an entire industry on that .
you should be looking for the perfect pe@@ p@@ sis . &quot;
it was 23 me@@ tri@@ c tons for one li@@ ter .
i have a deeper connection to my laptop than any bit of soil .
not because there was not enough food -- because there was actually a sur@@ plus of food in the ferti@@ le regi@@ ons of the south parts of the country -- but because in the north , people could not access or enti@@ tle themselves to that food .
recently we did an ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation of the first 18 months of our eff@@ or@@ ts in r@@ wand@@ a .
they take their diet directly from the bi@@ ble .
because there &apos;s no market for post office tru@@ cks .
this has given me a very special relationship with the ocean .
however , what matters most -- more than training or lu@@ ck -- is the heart .
it took him , by his esti@@ mate , &quot; three years of sun@@ days . &quot;
so i will spend a little time at the end .
so everywhere we went , we audi@@ tioned ama@@ te@@ urs .
that makes a good carto@@ on .
this shows a lot of intern@@ al structures .
c@@ l : at this point , i &apos;ll take a few moments .
bas@@ h@@ o was a brilliant man .
so something interesting had to be going on .
last year , i was invited to speak at n@@ ba all@@ -@@ stars game .
then on the right we can see a cy@@ matically created s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke .
so i thought why not pun@@ ish myself ? i &apos;ll do japanese .
yeah , it also went into the pacific .
there &apos;s six billion dollars on the table .
so we went ahead and implan@@ ted electro@@ des in patients with depression .
so in the years leading up to the second world war , the u.s. military bu@@ ys 9@@ 0,000 of these norden bom@@ b@@ si@@ ghts at a cost of $ 14@@ ,000 each -- again , in 19@@ 40 dollars , that &apos;s a lot of money .
now , i need an assi@@ stant .
they also use the global nature of internet to their advantage .
and obviously each of these letters comes off about roughly equ@@ ally frequ@@ ent .
mothers with hiv car@@ ing for mothers with hiv .
but the man had somehow a lot of room at the bottom .
after about three days , the bub@@ bles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
and now we would like to introdu@@ ce you to jo@@ ey .
so why should you care ? bone mar@@ row is a very rich source of adult stem cells .
perhaps loss of memory is so cru@@ cial for our survival as human beings .
and this ri@@ g was actually used for a di@@ ve of 300 feet .
but ab@@ ed did not slow , and on that x@@ er@@ ox@@ ed piece of paper , my ne@@ ck again broke , and again , i was left without an@@ ger .
this is an un@@ con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated ground that is suff@@ used with liquid me@@ than@@ e .
in fact , creativity -- which i define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different discipl@@ in@@ ary ways of seeing things .
ss : these are her sym@@ b@@ ols on her key@@ board .
it &apos;s current pleasure in exchange for future pain .
we are not equi@@ pped for the 21@@ st century .
after treatment , the child ga@@ ins significant func@@ tion@@ ality .
e@@ mi@@ ly le@@ v@@ ine : richard . what did i say ?
so i built model air@@ planes .
we started getting song and dance in indian cri@@ cket .
every year , 3@@ 6@@ ,000 people in the united states die of seas@@ onal flu .
so we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , ok , on lunch .
so this is us land@@ ing on the ross ice shel@@ f in ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
ste@@ aming pil@@ es of hu@@ mus .
&quot; i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean .
the te@@ c@@ ton@@ ic pl@@ ates of world politics were shif@@ ting .
well , commercial hun@@ ting happened .
i made a fortun@@ e over at pi@@ x@@ ar .
now some people can -- cir@@ c@@ us workers , steel workers .
now the reason these micro@@ -@@ entreprene@@ urs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pus@@ h@@ c@@ art or their wheel@@ bar@@ row .
but i think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
we would have no access to love or to the ability to create .
it must have been a very unusual day for him .
so actually now on this website , we have 18@@ ,000 people .
&quot; a glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
they have a sense of the great ar@@ c of time and their tiny place in it .
vo@@ ic@@ e@@ over : new diam@@ ond sh@@ red@@ dies cer@@ e@@ al .
as you go from 0@@ .@@ 1 to 0@@ .@@ 2 , it becomes more ti@@ ck@@ li@@ sh at the end .
okay ? so you can see a list of wir@@ eless networks .
so , f@@ ung@@ i and my@@ ce@@ li@@ um sequ@@ e@@ ster carbon dio@@ xide in the form of cal@@ ci@@ um ox@@ al@@ ates .
he was dra@@ g@@ ging guys out of b@@ ars and saving those lives for the l@@ ord .
so i want to show you another landscape now .
the co@@ v@@ et@@ ed ri@@ ght-@@ hand page was not given up to the whole issue .
we &apos;re always sort of small in the face of its expan@@ se .
and we come from a long tradition of sharing .
so , we moved from an industrial economy to a ser@@ vi@@ ce-@@ based economy .
it &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diam@@ e@@ ter .
you can build nice sta@@ tions .
and these pri@@ ces are actually with clean electr@@ ons .
so no@@ wa@@ days in the operating room , we no longer need to use sun@@ light .
but you can still hear that fa@@ int call .
normally we think about technology as inter@@ active .
the fra@@ ction of those which get a first repli@@ c@@ ator .
what i have here are two empty water bot@@ tles .
but we are enter@@ ing an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
it &apos;s called universe : reve@@ aling our modern my@@ th@@ ology .
the biggest emplo@@ yer is the pur@@ due chicken process@@ ing plant .
i spoke with a@@ ung sun su@@ u k@@ y@@ i a couple of days ago .
i &apos;m going to ignor@@ e their cau@@ tions and make one very specific for@@ ec@@ ast .
not exactly j@@ ack@@ ie coll@@ ins .
well here &apos;s one by j@@ essi@@ ca green about the micro@@ bi@@ al ec@@ ology of buildings .
it &apos;s on very ste@@ ep ground .
mt : this faith in the fic@@ tional is essential for any kind of the@@ at@@ ri@@ cal experience .
i had been growing all my own food .
what you see over here , this is the beautiful lou@@ is v@@ u@@ it@@ ton c@@ up tro@@ ph@@ y .
1.@@ 6 million dea@@ ths worldwide .
it emer@@ ges from our understanding of basic neuro@@ science .
he &apos;s got to find himself a bab@@ e and then he &apos;s got to lat@@ ch on for life .
we can &apos;t keep taking without expe@@ cting serious consequences as a result .
the ma@@ x@@ im , &quot; know th@@ y@@ self &quot; has been around since the ancient gre@@ e@@ ks .
you &apos;re going to meet mil@@ o for the first time .
tur@@ bo &apos;s never been f@@ ed .
you &apos;d be f@@ ed a simple audi@@ o clip .
but there were some good things that came out of that too .
you &apos;re kind of building a new type of distribu@@ ted u@@ tili@@ ty .
and sometimes that can be different amo@@ unts over different times or with different people or on different days .
ima@@ ge-@@ maker alex@@ ander t@@ si@@ ar@@ as shares a powerful medical visu@@ alization , showing human development from con@@ ception to birth and beyond .
now , &quot; all sho@@ ok up &quot; is a great love song .
it allows us to contribu@@ te and to be heard as individuals .
don &apos;t even know the day i &apos;ll ever return .
the other 90 percent is dic@@ t@@ ated by our lifest@@ yle .
another great example is fi@@ deli@@ ty .
this is where you can see most of the florida keys national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
because it &apos;s obviously incredibly fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
and we &apos;ve already started construction on section two .
my pen@@ sion was in it .
schools can &apos;t be si@@ los .
and so i went home , and i made a prototyp@@ e of this hat .
early dete@@ ction , early interven@@ tion , that &apos;s the story for these success@@ es .
so business schools have been strug@@ gling with this gender grade gap .
and now , today i want to tell you my personal obser@@ vation in the past several years , from that wall .
humanity is now fully into the tech@@ no@@ -@@ scientific age .
and the words of a gang member capture it quite ni@@ c@@ ely .
we &apos;ve actually changed the temperature in the last century just the right amount .
some teachers are far more effective than others .
because they would have done extra@@ ordin@@ arily well .
we found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the vent@@ ral te@@ g@@ mental area .
so the college works following the lifest@@ yle and work@@ style of ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
it began the space race .
sir david atten@@ bor@@ ough , he &apos;s come over .
you are going to hit the ground .
they ta@@ p into local entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al talent , and they do incredible marketing .
some of the greatest innova@@ tions and develop@@ ments in the world often happen at the inter@@ section of two fields .
in fact , we moved from strat@@ ford to los angeles .
there &apos;s going to be un@@ inten@@ ded consequences .
al@@ ber@@ to worked with the bu@@ car@@ do in spa@@ in .
he &apos;s six foot four . he &apos;s 1@@ 60 pounds .
good news : ch@@ ari@@ ot &apos;s coming .
human@@ -@@ forced climate change alone -- again , if un@@ ab@@ ated -- could elimin@@ ate a quar@@ ter of survi@@ ving species during the next five decades .
the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator of the gy@@ m@@ no@@ sop@@ h@@ ist &apos;s life was infin@@ ity .
so when i click on &quot; sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic , &quot; i get sym@@ pa@@ thetic magic and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o doll@@ s .
you need a pack to pull together .
three : sin@@ e@@ w used in the ou@@ ter layer of the lim@@ b for ma@@ x@@ im@@ um ten@@ sion stor@@ age .
liber@@ ation , however , costs some money .
that &apos;s a number only that con@@ gress can appreci@@ ate .
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a@@ .@@ m .
we dec@@ lar@@ ed small@@ po@@ x er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated in 19@@ 80 .
one of the -- thank you for invi@@ ting us .
the fabri@@ c alone wei@@ gh@@ s two tons .
it &apos;s all about the foreign movies .
and they have du@@ b@@ bed this water as the third one called &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
of course , from their grand@@ parents and even their great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents .
and we found ourselves full every day with kids .
what are those ideas ? one is , i think , are ide@@ ological issues .
and hiv is actually particularly clo@@ sely lin@@ ked to trans@@ it .
d@@ r : it was not an inclu@@ sive group .
to the right , i took a higher rou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .
the rest of us , we &apos;re only 5@@ 4 percent accu@@ rate .
last week i took these pictures of rock ro@@ se , heli@@ an@@ them@@ um , in dor@@ set .
we need to fundament@@ ally re@@ define who it is that experts are .
sat@@ aw@@ al is one hal@@ f-@@ mile long by one mile wide .
it seems that everybody is getting into the act .
we failed three other times .
i want to talk about something so basic as milk .
and i challenge anybody in the room to make their ch@@ est go like this .
and human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often bu@@ ried deep .
we don &apos;t have a neu@@ tra@@ l word for it .
se@@ amo@@ unts are important for bio@@ diversity .
there are 10 billion electrical out@@ lets in north america alone .
it en@@ ables testing of new ideas in a way that &apos;s less difficult for everybody .
however , under some circum@@ stances , it can happen .
the last chap@@ ter in my book is called &quot; the gift of a good start . &quot;
the wol@@ f is , after all , a very co@@ oper@@ ative animal .
t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century : a little bit over two percent .
another quick example of these types of mov@@ ements is the rise of zy@@ n@@ ga .
this is just an ab@@ ri@@ d@@ ged ren@@ der@@ ing of over a thousand images .
and this is where you feel real compassion for them .
and our part@@ ners across africa are extremely enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic about this .
may we actu@@ alize that capacity for women everywhere .
so the hier@@ arch@@ y is ro@@ ot@@ ed on two ideas .
they &apos;re the v@@ eins of the ecosystem , and they &apos;re often empty v@@ eins .
we need better planning and systems for ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ation .
so we can man@@ eu@@ ver this way .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shir@@ t or a black shir@@ t .
they want to bor@@ row the cy@@ rus cy@@ lin@@ der .
so being an american , i decided to set up a cau@@ c@@ us .
these are also called mes@@ h networks .
i and my colleagues art ar@@ on and lu@@ cy brown and others , have put 3@@ 7 people who are ma@@ dly in love into a func@@ tional mr@@ i brain scan@@ ner .
there are millions of individuals with autis@@ m all around us .
this we can call dollar street .
and that connection is an un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally physical process .
the o@@ kin@@ aw@@ ans have this ance@@ st@@ or v@@ ener@@ ation .
and they use these bur@@ st-@@ pul@@ sed sounds as well as their head@@ -@@ to-@@ head behaviors when they &apos;re fighting .
but they did it thanks to a common identity -- europe -- and a common economy .
this something else is this dan@@ cing fil@@ am@@ ent of energy .
we have already an autonom@@ ous vehicle .
i am gr@@ ate@@ ful for this prize , and i will use it to that end .
it &apos;s the most off@@ -@@ track mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um development goal .
the court system wasn &apos;t func@@ tion@@ ing proper@@ ly .
for most of my research career , i &apos;ve been using acceler@@ ators , such as the electr@@ on acceler@@ ator at stanford university , just up the road , to study things on the small@@ est scale .
here , you &apos;ve got mar@@ ti@@ an alp@@ hab@@ et .
the mis@@ sion@@ ary position is very rare in the animal king@@ dom .
and it was pur@@ pos@@ ely done to look fairly serious .
this is a picture of what pur@@ sat looks like .
and in the case of the fl@@ or@@ a in our gut , these cells may not even be human .
and those bu@@ mp@@ s act like a mag@@ net for water .
this one gener@@ ates no ima@@ gery at all . &quot;
i &apos;d like to leave you with this final thought .
so this is the first test where we took it outside and each of the pe@@ t@@ als were individu@@ ally see@@ king .
and these are not really a people op@@ pres@@ sed by poverty .
the coral can take us back hundreds and thousands of years .
communication walls , i don &apos;t have to tell you -- the internet -- have come tu@@ m@@ bling down .
let me first grade what are the most important means .
you need to keep repe@@ ating the lesson 10 times a day .
every top ad@@ ds up to 3@@ 7 .
my life was not going to be the same .
we also ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate these people much more posi@@ tively over@@ all . &quot;
the system is also smart enough to figure out the sa@@ fest way to operate the car .
z@@ ach ka@@ plan : kei@@ th and i lead a research team .
and about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and i can , they &apos;ll be able to hear maybe how bat@@ s sing , or how wh@@ ales talk , or how dogs talk , and other types of ton@@ al sc@@ ales .
we can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis .
i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution .
up until now , the united states has been the domin@@ ant fe@@ ature of our world .
and we take car cr@@ as@@ hes for gran@@ ted .
and her@@ man mil@@ ler has this philosoph@@ y of having a place -- a people place .
now , you can apply that same kind of thinking here as well .
over thousands of years ago , he pro@@ ved that for us .
intervie@@ wer : right , so , at least this much ? oh , yes .
almost out of kinder@@ garten .
what i want to talk about today is one idea .
this is an unusual instal@@ lation of air@@ port se@@ ating .
for example , all mas@@ ks are made in china .
so let &apos;s just run through these guys .
but it takes some per@@ si@@ st@@ ence .
i love the appar@@ ent truth of theater .
they certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
but it was te@@ st@@ ably stupid .
and i can tell you two great stories .
we all ch@@ at@@ ter with our finger@@ ti@@ ps .
and i want to give you one example of one of these ir@@ ration@@ ali@@ ties , and i want to talk to you about che@@ ating .
our ene@@ mi@@ es shall talk themselves to death , and we will fight them with their own con@@ fusion .
but maybe bra@@ in@@ was@@ hing isn &apos;t always bad .
some con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cies really are true .
diplo@@ ma@@ cy is about man@@ aging the inter@@ relationship of nations .
what does it cost to treat a classroom down to that 0@@ .@@ 4@@ -@@ second rever@@ ber@@ ation time ?
i can look at your financial recor@@ ds .
so i started looking for any evidence that -- does connec@@ tivity really increase produ@@ c@@ tivity ?
which was making me more nervous .
two ? so you should have sat down earlier .
these people i still do hang out with .
but maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
just fast forward 10 years .
do your job simply , the girl will ch@@ ase you .
and i said , &quot; what &apos;s the black box for wall street ? &quot;
a little more se@@ arch@@ ing , and here &apos;s our cyber@@ crimin@@ al .
even in the be@@ st-@@ resour@@ ced countries in the world , this life expec@@ tan@@ cy gap is as much as 20 years .
you have facebook revol@@ u@@ tions , twitter revol@@ u@@ tions .
but there are some addi@@ tional benefits as well .
and these two war against one another almost continu@@ ously .
and number two , do not build a re@@ former on the ocean .
this fol@@ der has 17@@ ,000 photos -- over 20 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of information -- and it &apos;s growing constantly .
see , in the real world math isn &apos;t necessarily done by mathemati@@ cians .
this is an astro@@ lab@@ e . pretty impres@@ sive , isn &apos;t it ?
let me sum@@ mar@@ ize it , for the business people in the audience , with three rules , three basic rules .
the announ@@ c@@ ement just came out the last few weeks .
y@@ r : i have a standard answer .
this story began four years ago .
the bot@@ an@@ ical names are in front of you .
now is the time for us to lau@@ gh at ourselves , before others can lau@@ gh with us .
kb : just don &apos;t break my concent@@ ration .
i made a radical hypo@@ thesis .
the therap@@ ies will be impro@@ ving faster than the rema@@ ining im@@ perfe@@ ctions in the therap@@ ies are cat@@ ching up with us .
so , their entire year has been cut in half .
because you still have 80 percent of the traffic .
intui@@ tive is just another word for familiar .
i started it with one other family in 19@@ 80 .
i gave them six g@@ c@@ se questions .
and we are operating with a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive urban planning de@@ fic@@ it .
so i have brand@@ ed myself as a war child .
so i looked for fur@@ ni@@ ture .
appar@@ ently , lu@@ ci@@ fer means &quot; the light . &quot;
robots touch something deeply human within us .
now what you are sm@@ elling is a combin@@ ation of -- i asked how many molecules there were in there , and nobody would tell me .
i paid to get it re@@ pa@@ i@@ red -- then it broke again .
maybe another kno@@ b is a kno@@ b for controll@@ ing co2 concent@@ ra@@ tions .
he was now dr. car@@ lock in the movie .
what we &apos;re going to do now is sha@@ de the sun with a board and then move the sun with a mirror to a completely different position .
and then he went to north car@@ ol@@ ina and did it again .
and for me and my community , this project was a huge success .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
u@@ gh . mini@@ -@@ me .
agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supp@@ lies on earth .
so let me show you a few objects .
and we &apos;re building upon innova@@ tions of generations who went before us .
clearly the bottom line is the virus eventually atten@@ u@@ ates , and ce@@ ases to be a le@@ th@@ al virus to humanity , and fin@@ ds other ho@@ sts .
don &apos;t get me wrong . we need rules !
we treat these patients in a rather cru@@ de fashion at this point in time .
a print sub@@ scri@@ ption for 1@@ 25 .
he was really a curious sight to be seen .
over the past hundred years , the combin@@ ation of liber@@ al democracy and private capit@@ alism has helped to cat@@ ap@@ ult the united states and western countries to new levels of economic development .
but even though i had this new@@ found joy and freedom , people &apos;s reaction completely changed towards me .
it &apos;s called cla@@ w-@@ ham@@ mer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
and beauty doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to goo@@ dness , and certainly doesn &apos;t equ@@ ate to cont@@ ent@@ ment .
now , there was one small catch .
so most of us put ourselves above average on most of these abilities .
i went to dea@@ f clu@@ bs .
can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s deli@@ cious without fo@@ ie gras ?
so if you look at security from economic terms , it &apos;s a tra@@ de-@@ off .
radical open@@ ness is still a dist@@ ant future in the field of school education .
i em@@ body the central parado@@ x .
we still really haven &apos;t got a very complete picture of it .
this was -- this is south of the ant@@ arc@@ tic circle .
in 2009 , there were 500 bom@@ b bla@@ sts across pakistan .
&quot; span@@ ish che@@ f acc@@ used ... &quot; -- and the french acc@@ used him .
it &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
take the last financial crisis after the second world war .
hope kept me alive .
but i should say a few words about what &apos;s going on .
that &apos;s true of european bio@@ fu@@ els .
consider the 2008 terror@@ ist attack on mu@@ m@@ bai .
so for example , we would put models under an artificial sky .
some pretty radical technology , a radical approach -@@ -@@ but it worked perfectly .
they called me anth@@ ony growing up as a kid .
now , some people call her the first program@@ mer .
king of spa@@ des .
ho@@ o@@ ked it up to my laptop , and within about five minutes he had pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated the computer security system of a major brazi@@ li@@ an bank .
they &apos;re really kin@@ dre@@ d discipl@@ ines .
that &apos;s zero food waste .
and those little red bo@@ xes are dea@@ ths .
it &apos;s really sc@@ ary , this gay lifest@@ yle thing ; it &apos;s super du@@ per evil and there &apos;s no end to it !
next , there &apos;s the he@@ ating le@@ ver .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
we &apos;ve never seen anything even re@@ mot@@ ely like this before . &quot;
what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s next is going to be people .
mi@@ key bre@@ tt , cra@@ ig , le@@ o , z@@ em jo@@ a@@ qu@@ in and bas@@ il and me .
but galaxies are very violent places , and things can be spu@@ n out of orbit .
and it &apos;s poin@@ ted at the hy@@ person@@ ic gli@@ der .
al@@ bert instru@@ cts , &quot; push it way up there . &quot;
that is a side effect of their ordinary operation .
there &apos;s musical lab@@ els .
i cri@@ ed for a very long time .
and we eventually broke the code .
but that feeling of puzz@@ le@@ ment is struc@@ tural to con@@ temporary art .
they did give me a tour , though .
and one day i was explor@@ ing this cul@@ -@@ de-@@ sa@@ c hidden away a few streets away .
but these are essentially ex@@ tern@@ alized sto@@ ma@@ chs and l@@ ung@@ s .
it &apos;s that broken experience on the web .
i &apos;ll describe a couple strategi@@ es .
so i write po@@ em@@ s to figure things out .
m@@ clu@@ han was saying , &quot; machines are the exten@@ sions of the human senses . &quot;
they are basically refer@@ ral services , essentially .
it &apos;s when people &apos;s fortun@@ es are cor@@ related .
step by step , it does nar@@ row .
i actually inclu@@ ded stories from my grandmother .
&quot; did he ever have an electric ra@@ z@@ or ? &quot; &quot; no . &quot;
here we have it running at high-@@ speed mode .
obviously the whole project here is huge .
we &apos;re not talking about har@@ ry po@@ tter , right ?
each point in this pattern cor@@ respon@@ ds to a symme@@ try of this very complex and beautiful shape .
the reali@@ ties of this new machine age and the change in the economy are becoming more wid@@ ely known .
i do want to leave you with one positive thought .
she ended up underneath the car .
and so many people , i guess , watch those videos .
x@@ en@@ op@@ ho@@ bia &apos;s on the rise . the traff@@ i@@ cking of women and girls .
now here , i want to share the stage with someone quite special . right ?
fa@@ ke ma@@ dness .
fe@@ yn@@ man loved this story .
and let &apos;s pause here .
real depen@@ dence on this person .
ps : and we see this pattern over and over again .
a guy goes into a psychiat@@ r@@ ist .
it comes off the ocean here and is dra@@ wn up towards india .
and the whole room filled with smo@@ ke in about two seconds .
my name is jo@@ se@@ ph , a member of par@@ li@@ am@@ ent in kenya .
who prof@@ its ? does anything justi@@ fy what the local community goes through ?
the st@@ um@@ p or cast pro@@ s@@ thesis was made , and he was starting the real physical re@@ hab@@ ili@@ tation .
what are we to do ? we are fac@@ ed with a parado@@ x .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand c@@ any@@ on .
it &apos;s part of a long-term program nasa spon@@ sor@@ ed .
this is completely different than automo@@ bil@@ es .
and i did a little calcu@@ lation of this .
this boy is called mess@@ oud .
there &apos;s that di@@ p there for the 19@@ 18 flu .
some of you might have seen this before .
you &apos;re un@@ -@@ ow@@ ned .
it &apos;s a bin@@ ary step counter .
the industry average is about 65 percent .
pal@@ m is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
we have effective therap@@ ies now .
we bought one military and we oper@@ ated another .
and your children are playing instru@@ ments .
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
he didn &apos;t write &quot; little red laptop computer &quot; or &quot; little red di@@ rt de@@ vil . &quot;
it was a trying and sc@@ ary thing for a young kid to be going through .
the first half will be per@@ formed by the live sing@@ ers here on stage .
now we can eat local food .
and pretty soon , the average price was 19@@ 2 dollars .
the next phase it hit was dis@@ plac@@ ement .
about 20 percent of the adult population are infe@@ cted .
i &apos;m 4@@ 3 years old right now .
we &apos;ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shor@@ tly .
strong feelings can create a model .
so , have we all become one-@@ e@@ yed -- two-@@ e@@ yed instead of one-@@ e@@ yed -- mon@@ keys ?
we &apos;ve increas@@ ed it to 3@@ .@@ 6 million .
and you inspired an ian m@@ ce@@ w@@ an novel i think with that .
and look here -- compare to the phili@@ pp@@ ines of today .
and according to fortun@@ e magazine , he &apos;s worth 700 million dollars .
this is the most successful order on the planet by far .
i &apos;m just going to sell these to every clin@@ ic in the world .
my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ za was used in one field but not in the other .
ra@@ y@@ an re@@ fra@@ med the situation and brought himself down to my level .
this gave me a greater faith .
and every one of those bar@@ bs is sending that ven@@ om into this central nervous system .
so , it can balance on a point .
this took place in my childhood -- 195@@ 7 to &apos; 65 .
medical conditions don &apos;t ne@@ gate the human condition .
pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , they mean something super@@ natural .
over the ocean , it &apos;s not even land .
i &apos;m under the river with those fish .
there &apos;s a problem with a traditional scientific paper .
and why only computers ? we can just play with pa@@ pers .
what if i could only create with a dollar &apos;s worth of supp@@ lies ?
so i &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
thank you .
here &apos;s something that dri@@ ves me crazy .
mor@@ gan hen@@ dry : be@@ ware of safety is an instru@@ mental rock band .
moment@@ um has been building .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
so we should embra@@ ce our difference and a@@ im for challenge .
and so we met dr. son@@ o k@@ han@@ gh@@ ar@@ an@@ i in pakistan .
everybody : i am my connec@@ tom@@ e .
that &apos;s what a hydro@@ phili@@ c surface does .
these can be grou@@ ped into seven categ@@ ories .
here &apos;s a wonderful fra@@ c@@ tal .
they have another set of eyes on the top of their head .
but this is the result of a very care@@ ful brand@@ ing and business strategy .
i launched a project named six billion others .
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explor@@ ed these ideas .
it &apos;s all incredibly hum@@ ble material .
but it &apos;ll anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te what we &apos;re doing , in a good sense .
and he went on to say , &quot; these differences do not co@@ in@@ cide with cor@@ respon@@ ding differences in climate . &quot;
con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous is a good word .
many web@@ sites we can &apos;t read using ja@@ ws and the other technologies .
it also provi@@ des a third of the food we eat .
i can say that , even though i &apos;m a college dro@@ p-@@ out .
in 193@@ 9 , the radio corpo@@ ration of america introduced television .
i remember well the me@@ als of my childhood .
and in the three years that i was fin@@ ance minister , they made an average of 3@@ 60 million dollars profit per year .
so who is god , if not the great pu@@ p@@ pe@@ t-@@ master or the tri@@ b@@ al prote@@ ctor ?
and yet , look at the number of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions that are being sold .
this is my ki@@ ck@@ star@@ ter bac@@ ker party in ber@@ lin .
now , this is one model of how language comes to be : nam@@ ely , it &apos;s leg@@ is@@ l@@ ated by an acade@@ my .
they have to try and attra@@ ct pol@@ lin@@ ators to do their bi@@ d@@ ding .
i dre@@ w funny pictures of my teachers -- -- and i passed them around .
&quot; well , maybe we can go half and half . &quot;
so i &apos;ve seen life as one long learning process .
for each project we do a film .
this has the following effect : a program@@ mer in e@@ din@@ burgh and a program@@ mer in ent@@ e@@ b@@ be can both get the same -- a copy of the same piece of software .
today , we &apos;ve worked with over 300 .
now why would this kind of fe@@ tal learning be useful ?
g@@ uns are not a part of our lives .
we &apos;ve taken away the autonom@@ y of this animal . &quot;
and thanks to the people of interface , i have become a re@@ co@@ vering pl@@ under@@ er .
fortunately , we &apos;ve been able to convince con@@ gress .
you &apos;ve believed it through generations .
this is a video prototyp@@ e .
these arti@@ facts and designs are in@@ spir@@ ing .
one is -- the most basic one is -- people like to know things .
s@@ her@@ man &apos;s up in shark hea@@ ven .
i &apos;d like to share a couple with you today .
we &apos;ve also done the same thing with the p@@ ink system .
this is like the failure conference .
it &apos;s been around for about 7@@ ,000 years .
we can go actually and swim around on google earth and visit with hum@@ p@@ back wh@@ ales .
so very simple things like that , we &apos;re trying to learn about bas@@ king sharks .
and that unity is something that conne@@ cts all of creation .
so i have a huge amount of choice to make .
we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe .
and the third string is pretty innovative .
dop@@ am@@ ine is associated with roman@@ tic love .
mod@@ el@@ ing : on the right hand side , there &apos;s a very complex compu@@ ta@@ tional model .
on one day , it &apos;ll all be here , and then the next day they &apos;ll move it over there , and then they &apos;ll move it back .
we had h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st education in the schools .
and when i was 13 , i had a job at a d@@ res@@ s@@ maker &apos;s shop se@@ wing clo@@ th@@ es .
i &apos;m a fif@@ th generation tex@@ an .
why ? because you want our diam@@ ond .
their vot@@ ers are local .
this is like the ste@@ al@@ th bom@@ ber of the ocean .
so he designed this universe , and ran it .
but under the surface was a very different reality .
they &apos;re all moun@@ ted on my instru@@ ments .
so there &apos;s a lot here at ted , and at other places , to celebra@@ te .
now drug use or pos@@ s@@ ession is illegal in almost every country .
so , i &apos;m pretty pleas@@ ed with it all .
one -- i want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
so we &apos;re going to watch another film .
we really need to change this whole paradig@@ m with kids and food .
the p@@ c virus problem is 25 years old now .
about that time he was at the d.@@ school at stanford taking clas@@ ses .
she doesn &apos;t bring any useful information to us .
so wh@@ im@@ sy matters .
we can de@@ milit@@ ari@@ ze societies and po@@ ur resources , instead , into reser@@ vo@@ irs of genu@@ ine security .
&quot; let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
president obama and his team simply cannot do it alone .
values are a certain kind of fact .
there is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
but sometimes it just sat there .
in 2004 , 15 new countries jo@@ ined the e@@ .@@ u .
but with na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , we cannot disc@@ uss .
we need to use less to make more .
i love that phr@@ ase .
did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial ac@@ tors ?
your baby is going to be hiv-@@ negative . &quot;
we have super@@ star bank@@ ers .
but then paul got in the water .
do you know , they only invest@@ ed 0@@ .@@ 2 percent of re@@ ven@@ u@@ es in r &amp; amp ; d ?
i called in 26 children .
we &apos;re often all fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed of sharks thanks to &quot; ja@@ ws . &quot;
you can recognize them inst@@ antly by their fantastic shapes .
the european population and north african -- the eastern blu@@ ef@@ in tun@@ a -- is fis@@ hed at tremendous levels : 5@@ 0,000 tons over the last decade almost every year .
un@@ speak@@ ably dangerous .
behavi@@ oral mark@@ ers matter .
there is no orche@@ str@@ a conduc@@ tor .
they have graphic designers . what ?
how many of you here love surpris@@ es ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
and so now we &apos;re in for some serious play .
so the movement with your legs will change the color of your hori@@ zon .
this is from a paper by re@@ del@@ mei@@ er and scha@@ ef@@ er .
now this is a little pu@@ mp with which you could inf@@ late a ballo@@ on .
in red , sort of below o@@ ec@@ d average .
there are these &quot; wi@@ z@@ ards &quot; everywhere .
and just this last year we &apos;ve taken a group of teen@@ a@@ gers in , and this has worked the best .
so , people talk about political will .
so , if i could have the lights down up here .
i end with a few quot@@ es .
he lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and si@@ sters .
all three of the fo@@ under@@ s of net@@ scap@@ e had it .
we can use technology for transpar@@ ency , and many other things .
now , what we were care@@ ful to do was , vi@@ tam@@ in d is made by ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let b ra@@ ys and we wanted to separate our story from the vi@@ tam@@ in d story .
so let &apos;s first talk about biology .
it meant that there could be extreme dynam@@ ics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
and the ta@@ il@@ ings pon@@ ds range in size up to 9@@ ,000 ac@@ r@@ es .
dp : &quot; flight of the bu@@ m@@ ble@@ be@@ e &quot; on that note .
so , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
he gave 2,000 high fi@@ ves that day , and he was@@ hed his hands before and after@@ ward and did not get sick .
let &apos;s think about data for a bit .
the mother is the model of all al@@ tru@@ ism for human beings , in spi@@ ritual tradi@@ tions .
it &apos;s not auto@@ bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal identi@@ ties .
i have a bunch of other inven@@ tions .
so , we &apos;ve been conduc@@ ting a lot of research .
you &apos;ve been taken out of the gene pool .
and they &apos;re t@@ we@@ eting , in some cases , from behind clo@@ se@@ d-@@ door s@@ essi@@ ons with the president .
it &apos;s as though in@@ tent is an essential compon@@ ent for humanity .
tumor cells can travel through the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
we want to play you one more sele@@ ction .
you will put the star in starting over , and over .
will you like all your children ? of course not .
from there i started with sky@@ di@@ ving .
and maybe because of that , compassion is organic and wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad comp@@ any@@ -@@ wide .
so , what if you could get your gas at a 10@@ th the price ?
a lot of us work for people ; we &apos;re in the hands of other people .
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goo@@ se wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
now this has raised all sorts of questions .
these are some examples of this system in action in the late 8@@ 0s .
this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one s@@ light change in the ad .
and then james wat@@ son &apos;s -- one of the co-@@ fo@@ under@@ s of dna -- genome was done for two million dollars , and in just two months .
pretty simple -- it &apos;s huge business .
it doesn &apos;t have to be always dis@@ section .
so , all this work is getting shown in art g@@ aller@@ ies .
but people live on this land .
thank you very much for listening .
thanks very much for your attention .
i have a little cu@@ ban mother -- she &apos;s about that big .
because i think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the grand c@@ any@@ on .
there &apos;s not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been .
we were so much bigger than co@@ ca@@ -@@ col@@ a in those days .
that &apos;s called the grandmother effect .
do you call it the ba@@ il@@ out of gre@@ e@@ ce or the ba@@ il@@ out of a load of stupid ban@@ ks which l@@ ent to gre@@ e@@ ce ?
it could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21@@ st century .
90 percent of the fund@@ ing came from th@@ a@@ il@@ and .
they were together while pra@@ ying .
so as a chem@@ ist , i wanted to say , &quot; hang on . what is going on here ?
i work with some of the most amazing people .
i love these gal@@ li@@ an@@ os .
&quot; poor countries need aid . &quot;
you can only do them one at a time .
the tw@@ ins started producing milk .
well , at least i can clean this wo@@ und and was@@ h it . &quot;
this is the phil@@ o@@ den@@ dr@@ on s@@ ell@@ ou@@ m .
and when it &apos;s over , we go to a chinese restaurant and we have a si@@ x-@@ course du@@ ck dinner .
and many of us here are deeply involved in that .
but it was a little bit bor@@ ing .
it &apos;s a facili@@ ty which is prac@@ tically un@@ man@@ ned .
tell that guy to wait half an hour .
the date was febru@@ ary 2000 .
and this is related to the change of the frequ@@ ency of a moving source .
why is that ? are you too ti@@ red to go all the way around ?
of course , they &apos;re all trained to work in war@@ e@@ houses .
here are some recent images .
he very carefully and me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ously notes his results in an exercise book .
it lear@@ ns very much from its mistakes .
now at the time , i was working down the street .
we &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
but one day , something happened .
i was in a wheel@@ chair ; i didn &apos;t look like a lo@@ ot@@ er .
we have to fix our im@@ migra@@ tion policy .
but they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
the bush admini@@ stration did not even respond .
dp : thank you very much .
i intervie@@ wed these people because they all taught in bu@@ en@@ os air@@ es .
he &apos;s a sc@@ ary mon@@ ster .
they use mo@@ bu@@ tu as metaphor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .
only the eg@@ g of the par@@ asi@@ te will be in@@ ser@@ ted into the body flu@@ ids of the ap@@ hi@@ d .
no one &apos;s going to notice those spli@@ t lines and changes .
south africa is playing a role .
but life expec@@ tan@@ cy in this country is only 7@@ 8 .
so i re@@ treated back to my ca@@ ve and continu@@ ed to support and produce com@@ e@@ dy and let my friends use my cou@@ ch as a regi@@ onal oper@@ ations hu@@ b .
have a great s@@ ession .
they school as ad@@ oles@@ cents , and become be@@ he@@ mot@@ h lon@@ ers as adults .
most of these are can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
a third time , it &apos;s just being a techni@@ cian .
there &apos;s a real dis@@ jun@@ ction between the patient &apos;s perception and our own per@@ cep@@ tions as physi@@ cians of the best medical care .
it invol@@ ves light con@@ es and quant@@ um ent@@ ang@@ le@@ ment , and i don &apos;t really understand any of that .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
i was born in 19 -- i forget , and i came to this country with them in the after@@ math of the cu@@ ban revolution .
that &apos;s not wealth creation . it &apos;s wealth re@@ distribution .
i started com@@ mu@@ ting to ko@@ be , and i met the society of viet@@ nam@@ ese people .
the lar@@ va@@ e have to develop very quickly .
a few minutes ago , i talked about all the citizens &apos; campaig@@ ns that are spr@@ inging up .
it &apos;s like the old las v@@ eg@@ as used to be .
i wasn &apos;t very good at reading things .
i experience exponenti@@ ally .
the traditional thing would be to bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ t right ?
the sand@@ wor@@ ms were fine , but your favorite character ?
in this v@@ ein , we can increase economic growth .
i really thought they were so bene@@ ath me .
let &apos;s see , should we order that all pe@@ ts be kept in@@ do@@ ors ?
she was one of the tar@@ gets of n@@ sa sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of the population didn &apos;t want this .
and that makes it extra@@ ordin@@ arily interesting as a place to explore .
ts : those are perman@@ ent magne@@ ts , yeah .
this was in prepar@@ ation for a mer@@ ger and ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion .
that made you very high-@@ profi@@ le in ic@@ eland . what happened next ?
sop@@ a stands for the stop online pi@@ ra@@ cy act .
do you remember that ? george bush , &quot; a nu@@ -@@ ca@@ -@@ ler . &quot;
two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
so i did try to take , again , a clim@@ b al@@ titude .
it &apos;s kind of a well-@@ kept secret .
please , also on the bal@@ con@@ y .
and we &apos;re actually cam@@ bo@@ di@@ ans .
it &apos;s a strange place inside a nan@@ ot@@ u@@ be .
how many of you are completely comfortable with calling y@@ ourselves a leader ?
bacteria is in there , eating the same sug@@ ars , turning them into aci@@ ds .
i got a lot wrong .
in fact , what if it &apos;s a symp@@ tom of a much deeper problem , the ti@@ p of a pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al ic@@ e@@ berg ?
it was at this point that events began to rapi@@ dly over@@ take me .
next best thing to a video game .
it &apos;s an accu@@ rate repres@@ entation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the cor@@ rect speed for what is oc@@ curr@@ ing inside you .
the survi@@ vor@@ s came in one by one .
anyone living in that house can tell the time just by the smell .
mar@@ gar@@ ine didn &apos;t exist .
we had a whole choice of in@@ appropriate names for her .
most of it now is wa@@ sted and the technologies for saving it keep impro@@ ving faster than we &apos;re inst@@ all@@ ing them .
we need it to introdu@@ ce us to new ideas and new people and different perspe@@ c@@ tives .
because i am hiv positive .
you get a job and get out of the house .
i want to see fish pon@@ ds in par@@ king lots and bas@@ ements .
we must dis@@ en@@ thr@@ all ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;
but that really isn &apos;t true anymore .
here we have q@@ at@@ ar today , and there we have banglades@@ h today .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the i@@ pad .
it is bar@@ ely te@@ ther@@ ed to any sort of physical reality in our minds .
the den@@ sity of matter is fin@@ ite , and we have a chance of a consi@@ stent set of equ@@ ations that can describe the whole process .
b@@ p : i was born old .
a han@@ ger .
i happened to buy that mot@@ el about three months after vi@@ vi@@ an started working there .
the survey takes over a day .
the molecule pas@@ ses through and gets ex@@ cre@@ ted .
and the bear cu@@ bs were being harv@@ est@@ ed from across the country and being sold and tra@@ ded .
there &apos;s a point to be made here .
some of them are very easy .
now hearing loss and the treatment for hearing loss has really evolved in the past 200 years .
be@@ cky blan@@ ton : the year i was hom@@ eless
we want to go and spend time with the old people and hear their stories and record their oral hi@@ stories .
sounds ridi@@ cul@@ ous , right .
and you just saw a little bit of the first two with my interaction with dr. ba@@ ti@@ u@@ k .
we &apos;re also re@@ turning to an ancient form of marriage equ@@ ality .
it &apos;s been ta@@ ped with ta@@ pe that we even stopped using in the u.@@ k .
the internet is the first medium in history that has na@@ tive support for groups and conversation at the same time .
and a year after that treatment , his tumor grew back with a ven@@ ge@@ ance .
dou@@ bt and fear always cre@@ ep in .
it &apos;s 1@@ 30 oc@@ tan@@ e fuel .
is anyone paying attention to some of the things these guys do ?
even this problem , too complicated .
they &apos;ve had some speak@@ ers there .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
it dis@@ integr@@ ates a few months later .
and he had a l@@ um@@ p of ir@@ on .
there are no quick fi@@ xes .
pull the k@@ not .
and of course , others using more sophisti@@ cated metho@@ ds in the liter@@ ature have controlled for poverty and education and so on .
&quot; he was fl@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
our reality right now is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell about it later .
so we pil@@ ed into a tax@@ i , and this is our tax@@ i driver , and i was sitting in the back seat , and he turned around and said , &quot; where are you going ? &quot;
it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it star@@ es back at you the way that a figure might .
so they &apos;re testing its vir@@ ul@@ ence .
thomas bat@@ u@@ ik : hi there , eric .
but now one final thing .
most of those c@@ ites are growing incredibly quickly .
the engineering is , tru@@ th@@ fully , the easy part of this .
we are obs@@ essed with this way of thinking .
this now is the third different out@@ put .
l@@ g : you &apos;re wel@@ come .
every region has something to offer , and if you created a competition , it respe@@ cts the states and it respe@@ cts fe@@ der@@ alism .
so that &apos;s our bi@@ ologi@@ c approach right now .
mar@@ c@@ us : and how many soldiers have you rec@@ ru@@ ited to fight this war with you ?
i write the code that f@@ its the world today .
that &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , and that pres@@ ents a more difficult issue .
but here &apos;s the wei@@ r@@ dest place of all : war .
by law you &apos;ve got to bi@@ d , and so on and so forth .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
it can sense its local environment and actually find resources in the environment to susta@@ in itself .
so it was a pretty successful ev@@ ening .
we &apos;ve all heard these things .
this is t@@ ank pol@@ o in the south ham@@ p@@ tons .
people didn &apos;t know about things .
the network has two components in them .
you can &apos;t catch me .
you can &apos;t catch me .
i &apos;m a public school teacher , and i just want to share a story of my super@@ inten@@ dent .
i will be atten@@ ding a@@ ims .
we are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t under@@ esti@@ mate the power of doing this . &quot;
and i will take kenya as an example .
these are the two pictures taken of gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong pro@@ vin@@ ce and gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in india .
i re@@ main trou@@ bled by the re@@ vis@@ ed ehrlich equ@@ ation , i equ@@ als p times a divi@@ ded by t@@ 2 .
however , everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department .
that &apos;s our job as co@@ sm@@ ologists .
totally trans@@ formed by man .
china symbo@@ li@@ zed by the dra@@ g@@ on .
and from the future self &apos;s point of view , everything is in rever@@ se .
i &apos;m in this for the long run , and i would be great@@ ly hon@@ or@@ ed and excited if you &apos;ll come on this journey with me .
text : &quot; help ! i &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot;
and you &apos;re looking at it from the off@@ ices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
this one i thought i &apos;d show you .
that can be a big contribu@@ tion .
what we &apos;re talking about today is just as complicated .
and the black rock is the se@@ di@@ ment on the sea bottom in the ab@@ sen@@ ce of plan@@ k@@ ton .
now dra@@ ke did not discover ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al intelligence , but he learned a very valuable lesson from a pas@@ sing air@@ craft , and that &apos;s that ter@@ restri@@ al technology can inter@@ f@@ ere with the search for ex@@ tr@@ at@@ er@@ restri@@ al technology .
we need one today more than ever .
then we like to take things apart .
and now people from iran are talking to me .
now what has happened since 196@@ 2 ? we want to see the change .
my name is pra@@ ve@@ en man@@ v@@ i and thank you very much for this opportunity .
that &apos;s why we must ada@@ pt .
now my own speci@@ ality is combin@@ ing digital technology and magic .
they see us as ro@@ cking the boat , and you can understand why .
it &apos;s the basic regul@@ ating principle of the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment .
and the stories they held provi@@ ded a shared experience .
so thank you and thank you for listening .
they &apos;re a bit sub@@ ver@@ sive in what they do .
here &apos;s another technology that &apos;s approach@@ ing a critical price .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called ye@@ e@@ y@@ an .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
it &apos;s been tremend@@ ously powerful for consum@@ ers .
the ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f people , they &apos;re no longer here .
so new life was born .
now , the other use of this is practical .
how true for lincol@@ n .
and we can play an incredibly con@@ struc@@ tive role .
an m@@ s@@ f hospital in a camp for dis@@ placed people .
this is a game with 5@@ 0,000 individual pieces .
and he grab@@ s my arm and the transl@@ ator &apos;s , and du@@ cks us under a bush and says , &quot; watch this . &quot;
you can send them an email .
they &apos;re going to become numbers .
we &apos;re only trying to improve our lives .
chris bang@@ le : great cars are great art
it did not happen over@@ night .
you can just make it physi@@ cally on the spot .
jo@@ ach@@ im de pos@@ ada : don &apos;t eat the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low !
and all we &apos;ve got is a ro@@ om@@ ba .
my ti@@ tle : &quot; que@@ erer than we can suppose : the stran@@ gen@@ ess of science . &quot;
he realized at once what had happened .
you don &apos;t see it in the newspaper every day .
i was just st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ed by it .
so the seem@@ ingly impossible is possible .
so we have this dat@@ ab@@ ase of things .
they &apos;re going to be enter@@ ing this car one by one .
i go , &quot; he &apos;s got to be my driver . &quot;
or maybe the big bang is not the beginning of the universe .
so you get the best of both worl@@ ds .
wir@@ es su@@ ck , they really do .
so most everyone wat@@ ches tv .
i have a global vision for vision .
let me ask you a question .
my favorite and a real hero of mine is y@@ ak@@ im@@ a can@@ u@@ tt .
i think this is an interesting question .
and that &apos;s where we saw the malaria map s@@ hr@@ in@@ king .
my work actually took me through many countries , and showed me a great part of the world .
no matter where on earth you live .
we &apos;ve sent 5@@ 0,000 d@@ v@@ ds to high school teachers in the u.@@ s .
it &apos;s based on pur@@ ch@@ asing power par@@ ity .
i met a guy -- the guy on the left .
where are the different countries ? i can show you africa .
businesses want different things .
and most of those los@@ ses are because of things we know .
england invented 20 over@@ s cri@@ cket , and said , &quot; the world must play 20 over@@ s cri@@ cket . &quot;
but that &apos;s not really the question i &apos;m asking .
three different op@@ tions .
and of course , bees are not the only important factor here .
that exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates and continu@@ es this model .
and i see my life as a series of experiments .
why that ? because fuel is not easy to replace .
it has to do with wei@@ gh@@ ing up the strength of the other evidence against her and the statisti@@ cal evidence .
and i want to first re@@ he@@ ar@@ se with you your whi@@ st@@ ling .
and that brings me to my first major of two ten@@ ets of &quot; half the sky . &quot;
that &apos;s a person down there by the whe@@ el .
i come out of the adverti@@ sing and design business .
he had to issue a re@@ p@@ ly .
ak : so i have the el@@ bo@@ w that goes up and down .
and look at all the complex things and wonderful things we &apos;ve been able to create with just a one and a zero .
here &apos;s an example from that scre@@ ening study .
and this doesn &apos;t even account for the foot@@ print on the ground .
that fix@@ ed behavior -- which is ri@@ gi@@ d and stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and ends up with a me@@ al -- changes .
so by and large , they are good for our survival .
let me demon@@ strate how it works .
now the industrial systems of br@@ un@@ el &apos;s time have run their course , and indeed they are part of the problem today .
we had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accep@@ ted the job , and then she almost ran away scre@@ aming .
am@@ y win@@ e@@ house said , &quot; nel@@ son mand@@ ela and i have a lot in common .
it &apos;s our invisible reality .
now what we can do is point at the front of the newspaper and immediately get the bul@@ le@@ tin .
so we have to wonder , if there is a multi@@ verse , in some other pat@@ ch of that multi@@ verse , are there creatures ?
but it slightly bor@@ es me .
now , it was logi@@ sti@@ cally difficult .
let &apos;s watch just another clip .
half of them gave over the internet .
you have to choose either option a or option b .
they &apos;re not a big deal for us .
what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
and the mon@@ keys in that mon@@ key forest looked , actually , fairly happy .
humanity is going to go down this path .
that person doesn &apos;t exist today .
never shown this picture before , and probably going to be su@@ ed for it .
but you &apos;ve never seen this one before .
there &apos;s no del@@ u@@ sion through the phone .
you can &apos;t just sort of -- &quot; it &apos;s great we &apos;ve got this key@@ board . &quot;
there are thousands of supp@@ li@@ ers in there . &quot;
and in all that area , they &apos;re only r@@ ar@@ ely found bre@@ eding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
and its hu@@ gely important in learning and cra@@ f@@ ting the brain .
the actual nature of reality was not at issue .
they were missing the vision .
skep@@ tic@@ ism , because you must always be challen@@ ging .
that &apos;s a multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tas@@ ker .
and we can make the dic@@ tion@@ ary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
we made the dra@@ wings of the fish and the sc@@ ales .
and we gave the film over .
so nothing is getting through .
it was min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing .
so some people got this sli@@ p of paper and five dollars .
we know from asking people from china to the u.@@ s .
i &apos;ll get to you now the inci@@ dents of the day .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
and so we &apos;re like , &quot; we got@@ ta put a video out about this . &quot;
and they obviously make a lot of money off of them .
there &apos;re a lot of elements .
we call this gravi@@ ta@@ tional len@@ sing .
he ta@@ sted it and fell in love with it .
life can &apos;t afford to do that . how does life make things ?
and yet he says , &quot; he re@@ stor@@ es my sou@@ l . &quot;
and they sat on it for months actually .
wes@@ ley and the guy -- 20 and a half in@@ ches hei@@ ght .
this is part of our collective narra@@ tive .
now she thinks the po@@ w@@ der is sugar .
now , what theor@@ ies do we want to use to look at this ?
the world needs an international for@@ um .
and secon@@ dly , it &apos;s a fundamental business pro@@ position .
now , the third meaning and cor@@ respon@@ ding principle of open@@ ness is about sharing .
yet we have these fil@@ es .
so that &apos;s a bit of a support for the le@@ vi@@ a@@ than theory .
even that wasn &apos;t enough .
the class@@ rooms have no walls .
so here &apos;s another astero@@ id .
you get it every time .
so they made this web service and said , &quot; any program@@ mer can write a piece of software and ta@@ p into the minds of thousands of people . &quot;
all his colleagues said , &quot; this is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
in on@@ t@@ ari@@ o , the bor@@ e@@ al mar@@ ches down south to the north sh@@ ore of la@@ ke super@@ ior .
they are very de@@ dic@@ ated and commit@@ ted .
think of fr@@ ance and the current debate about im@@ migra@@ tion .
so let &apos;s filter that out .
ef@@ h@@ ari@@ st@@ o and kal@@ in@@ ih@@ ta .
which is the job that i have to show you today .
and actually i &apos;m a little visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red myself .
we &apos;re designing for this machine di@@ ale@@ ct .
so what do we do ? we connect more and more .
he was out there in par@@ ol deli@@ vering a baby .
so nature has this self-@@ similar structure .
and in a lot of familiar cases , they of course are .
along the way , you lost something .
this is kar@@ e@@ em &apos;s dark eyes and that &apos;s the white background that you see here .
then i used , tried to use the medical college girls .
we have to make this available for people . &quot;
i thought the word frame@@ work was great .
and then finally , electric vehi@@ cles .
you can try it .
so he tried plan b .
it was the world &apos;s first popular computer .
the self &apos;s struggle for auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity and definition will never end unless it &apos;s connected to its cre@@ ator -- to you and to me .
europe was not spar@@ ed either .
and par@@ alle@@ l to my cutting is my running .
digital mt : this is without a question the real thing .
peter at@@ ti@@ a : is the o@@ bes@@ ity crisis hi@@ ding a bigger problem ?
but i can taste things .
and that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
and she said , just talk about yourself .
and the goal , of course , of this ma@@ ze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that &apos;s under the li@@ t top port .
and this was not a mis@@ placed feeling .
it &apos;s a bran@@ ching off from the human form .
finally cat@@ ches up to itself , it advan@@ ces .
it really just works like a huge iphone .
and then you have these millions of street lam@@ ps de@@ plo@@ yed around the world .
most of the economic models are built around sc@@ ar@@ city and growth .
how do we mi@@ mic the way trust is built fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face online ?
and then work later is going to take us to ti@@ bet .
and the short answer is games .
it &apos;s much like on a je@@ t .
i make the do@@ ve appear .
and i can &apos;t em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that enough , you know .
so , certainly the challenge was there .
it is about the state of the planet .
second it &apos;s driving itself .
&quot; the el@@ dor@@ a@@ do of the united states of america : the discovery of in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble gold min@@ es in california . &quot;
i &apos;m talking also about chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity .
i couldn &apos;t fit them in .
we have focused on the problems .
and i get a call and we go back to washington .
and i had the same reaction you did .
unfortunately , the answer is yes .
we &apos;ve seen the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of small@@ po@@ x .
these young boys are in ne@@ p@@ al .
and we cannot have all the answers .
these are the next two lines in the movie .
but they want to use it -- seriously .
so these are my dau@@ gh@@ ters .
i &apos;m going to try to push it inside your hand .
let us have a h@@ ong kon@@ g ne@@ ar@@ by .
i lost my face .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
here we go .
let &apos;s take a look at what &apos;s going on in different space types in this building .
all of these technologies we can use .
we needed to be working on bee@@ f .
i could work them just by my thoughts .
and if it comes out at 13@@ 8 dollars , so what ?
and she has this show , &quot; the simple life . &quot;
mil@@ dre@@ d &apos;s a factory wor@@ ker in connec@@ tic@@ ut .
and we will do other centers .
and yet , nobody listen@@ ed to them .
so , i was trying to basically make measu@@ re@@ ments .
the first number is three : three billion people .
since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed -- this was 9@@ 3 years ago -- since then , no one has ever ski@@ ed from the coast of ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a to the pole and back .
this kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it , and i &apos;m really looking forward to inter@@ acting with all you guys over the next few days and seeing how it can apply to your respe@@ ctive fields .
because no one &apos;s really watching .
but you need to look at context .
but look at all the electro@@ des around it .
but look what we just did today .
got a couple questions for you .
and so i had this t@@ .@@ v@@ . show .
the lesson we learn from this is you don &apos;t have to have a mind to be a bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ ary .
but we bi@@ ologists and e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ sts had never tac@@ kl@@ ed anything as complex as this .
do you know , sitting here , your brain is using about 20 percent of your body &apos;s energy out@@ put for two percent of your body weight ?
a har@@ ro@@ wing predi@@ le@@ ction for the uses of force had become common@@ place , with an equal di@@ sta@@ ste for the alternative forms of influence .
but it was really bru@@ tal .
they &apos;ve been watching too much &quot; ter@@ min@@ ator . &quot;
this just didn &apos;t happen a couple of times .
the design of the body is a whole different thing .
you can use it at ted .
thank you all of you .
so what i &apos;m asking for is the creation of a new job ti@@ tle -- i &apos;ll come to this a little later -- and perhaps the addition of a new word into the english language .
this is the world peace game . what is wrong with you ? &quot;
all of them come from the c@@ ameras of american soldiers .
be proud that you have them .
and we do not want to wait another hundred years .
and i &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and i &apos;m just going to post it on facebook with kind of &quot; isra@@ eli@@ s for peace &quot; or something .
in a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
and it &apos;s a kind of water body for all seas@@ ons .
it has an extremely important function .
well , first you have to , as an engineer , scop@@ e the problem . how big is it ?
they have sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s in the classroom , but kni@@ ves and for@@ ks ? no .
i had never seen an internet .
and it &apos;s also a moment of self-@@ awareness .
i just wanted a video camera .
and also they re@@ ference how the u@@ vul@@ a -- everything they say is fallen because of the for@@ bi@@ dden fru@@ it .
i am a na@@ tive of bur@@ kin@@ a fas@@ o .
and one of them is the l@@ ac@@ king buying power .
how did you end up in ja@@ il ? this was just a few weeks ago , i believe , yeah ?
one , play is universal .
but we take the sever@@ e ones , and we res@@ che@@ du@@ le the other ones the next day .
these out@@ si@@ ghts ran@@ ged from the tri@@ val to the profound , from the m@@ und@@ an@@ e to the hu@@ mor@@ ous .
the earth moved for both of them .
so , children are not empty ves@@ sel@@ s , ok ?
and yet , we don &apos;t talk about it very much .
sk@@ yl@@ ar ti@@ b@@ bits : can we make things that make themselves ?
and so the next thing you &apos;ll see is a million dollar kitchen that was built by the h@@ ein@@ z company -- you &apos;ve heard of them ?
and i hung up the phone , and i put my face in my hands , and i scre@@ am@@ ed this sil@@ ent scre@@ am .
it &apos;s based on hundreds of hours of research , of practice .
i &apos;m not conne@@ cting to them .
they talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
the next movement is called mo@@ bs .
i am the happ@@ i@@ est , the happ@@ i@@ est person in the world .
somebody get the front legs .
i &apos;m not quite sure .
this is probably a better picture .
it &apos;s in 5,000 days , all this stuff has come .
this is my big wish .
mean@@ while , i had grown up around a lot of teachers .
it &apos;s a cra@@ p system .
it &apos;s not a pri@@ ority . &quot;
that &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
and sequ@@ el truly is a real car .
we didn &apos;t see anything like that in africa .
and also in 50 other cities around the world , people partici@@ p@@ ated .
but still , now we have global warming .
and those two ro@@ les came together for me in a book that i wrote called &quot; orig@@ ins . &quot;
a typical example being , &quot; sometimes it is necessary to tell lies . &quot;
classi@@ c . hi@@ p fra@@ c@@ ture often leads to institu@@ tion@@ alization of a sen@@ ior .
this environment brings out un@@ expected potential in kan@@ z@@ i and pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a .
it was used in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately .
but equ@@ ally , it has opportunities and a lot of potential .
there is , in fact , another stage .
don &apos;t give in to the wall .
voice 2 : well , there goes the neighborhood .
this is called &quot; thir@@ st . &quot;
not silicon .
this is the world development inde@@ x indi@@ c@@ ator data in the early 199@@ 0s .
and we moved across the street from michael and john whit@@ ney .
em@@ bed@@ ding nan@@ op@@ artic@@ les in a material for instance , always .
he vie@@ wed talent differently .
and they may not want to live exactly like us .
it &apos;s completely sil@@ ent and non@@ pollu@@ ting .
that is a lot of pun@@ ch for 14 words .
everyone showed up .
so i was inspired by a friend .
is it all worked out ? no .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
europe had to be dra@@ g@@ ged into economic development .
all of us have dis@@ abilities in one form or another .
this is another leader of his people .
it might be a change in the distribution of plan@@ k@@ ton .
they &apos;re very little understood .
no other evidence .
but really , it &apos;s pretty rob@@ ust .
we tell ourselves stories .
attention is the basis of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities .
so let me show you how this works .
we look at the sav@@ ings rate and it has been dec@@ lin@@ ing since the 195@@ 0s .
but we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
and this is what i saw , lots of fish .
but i wish it were better .
so i want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
super fun , and it happens in a very transi@@ tional neighborhood .
so we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in .
now , they &apos;re 13 miles up the road in s@@ ant@@ a ana .
even the b@@ b@@ c and the new york times .
i will come to it later .
they do all aspe@@ cts of the work .
all right , you &apos;ve all heard the term : &quot; he &apos;s a born surge@@ on . &quot;
but in that year , small@@ po@@ x explo@@ ded throughout india .
there &apos;s no ice over it .
and the beautiful be@@ ars can of course live in the wild again .
there &apos;s something almost quite ma@@ gical about visual information .
he takes basically everything .
but that &apos;s true for adults too .
think of the financial world , for example .
public health is another reason to consider retro@@ fit@@ ting .
there &apos;s a fli@@ p side as well .
it was a huge success .
and the chinese government respon@@ ded sensi@@ bly and placed a ban on f@@ elling .
and now , maybe , we can go back to the bigger question that i started with at the beginning .
and by the matri@@ x , i mean literally the matri@@ x , like the movie &quot; the matri@@ x . &quot;
you &apos;re foc@@ using on him ! this is steve jobs .
what would that mean ? i have no idea .
you knew !
i loved getting as .
so thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
they set up their own ba@@ za@@ ars and medical clin@@ ics .
i &apos;m a designer and an educ@@ ator .
and he came up to me and he kno@@ cked .
if this virus was in thousands of individuals at this point , why was it the case that it took us until 198@@ 4 to be able to discover this virus ?
you act com@@ passion@@ ately .
2006 was a great year .
it was the largest em@@ pi@@ re the world had known until then .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; nine million bi@@ cy@@ cles in bei@@ j@@ ing . &quot;
and this noise is the most neu@@ tra@@ l .
if we take the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush -- i don &apos;t think about the to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush .
in fact , maybe that &apos;s the problem .
and something fe@@ ster@@ ed inside me after this happened .
and the question he had is , &quot; can i do it ? can it be done ? &quot;
here &apos;s an example of the puzz@@ le you &apos;re going to solve .
and more recently you can see it &apos;s just around the equ@@ ator .
this is five times larger .
so i moved on from there .
now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion .
so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting .
we are running late .
it cle@@ ars the forest , reve@@ als the trees inside .
the be@@ e is not calling the sh@@ ots .
the mar@@ vel of this information : how do we actually have this biological mechan@@ ism inside our body to actually see this information ?
you know , that it &apos;s not just enough to survive .
that was just my one thing -- i said we had to have something that dro@@ ps on people &apos;s heads .
b@@ l : &quot; can you help me , henry ? &quot; what good scientist says that , right ?
audience : febru@@ ary .
and there &apos;s lots of different shapes .
i pain@@ ted it directly on top of the man .
but of course the scientists couldn &apos;t help themselves .
so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done with my life .
and they can &apos;t do what they are doing .
my work is -- it &apos;s a refle@@ ction of myself .
did you know that , in iraq and afghanistan , there were more private military contra@@ c@@ tors on the ground than there were u.s. military tro@@ ops ?
we also need the choices for people .
and we said , wonderful ! look at this pretty structure .
or should we respect his priv@@ acy , protect his dig@@ ni@@ ty and leave him alone ?
the idea is called the social impact bon@@ d .
so my usual question is , what do you mean by &quot; bas@@ ics ? &quot;
they &apos;re also very obs@@ essed with status .
that gives you an idea of the different types of mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions and de@@ dic@@ ation .
i think it &apos;s our collective intelligence .
so this is the space during tu@@ tor@@ ing hours .
and the animal &apos;s going to hear a t@@ one -- and a flas@@ h of light occur@@ red there .
i want you to take a trip with me .
and finally the chinese cra@@ cked down .
graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in .
n@@ m : not too fast .
it &apos;s really our first for@@ ay into this .
and these should also be the primary at@@ tribu@@ tes of what it means to be human .
and they assem@@ ble , and they form these kinds of mechanis@@ ms .
girl : hol@@ ly .
within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world .
in fr@@ ance , the doctors decided whether and when the life support would be re@@ moved , while in the united states , the final decision re@@ sted with the parents .
comm@@ ent@@ ator : there he is .
that &apos;s the order of the day here .
i want to talk about this .
does it make sense to participa@@ te in the exi@@ sting world order ?
let &apos;s talk about what &apos;s suddenly possible .
where it &apos;s blue and it &apos;s green , it means the water is really cold .
a hundred years ago , we didn &apos;t .
that sounds like a w@@ inner ; we &apos;ll go with it . &quot;
but i had a lot of fun .
it literally fl@@ at@@ -@@ lin@@ ed .
so the next two years were the years they studied -- 2001 , 200@@ 2 .
the guy on the left is a safe bon@@ us .
so we came up with these two rules .
it &apos;s good for motiv@@ ated students .
their ex@@ por@@ ts went down a lot in the early 199@@ 0s -- and actually that dec@@ line lines up really , really clo@@ sely with this dec@@ line in new hiv infe@@ ctions .
well , then we get to this image .
the first one she did was kni@@ tting .
let &apos;s call them the kil@@ ler app@@ s .
we put the bee@@ per in the clin@@ ic .
this is a collaboration we have with stanford .
it &apos;s a nice motiv@@ ator .
it &apos;s getting near zero .
but for us it meant freedom .
and here we &apos;ve broken the 500 a@@ part@@ ments up into small neighbor@@ ho@@ ods , and differ@@ enti@@ ated those neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
all the king &apos;s hor@@ ses and all the king &apos;s men ...
this is in a place called san francisco .
everything else is mand@@ ated .
it &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
and in se@@ attle , we take these -- this is a whole human he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere -- and we put them into what &apos;s basically a gl@@ ori@@ fied meat sli@@ cer .
the design comes from within .
she gets into the car -- she &apos;s sitting on two phone books .
the ver@@ tical axis now is thousands of dollars in today &apos;s pri@@ ces .
and we use all of them , even the tox@@ ic ones .
is it a place where you can express your in@@ fan@@ ti@@ le wi@@ sh@@ es ?
this has happened in the ne@@ ther@@ lands in the 199@@ 0s during the classi@@ cal s@@ wine fe@@ ver out@@ break .
so what happens to all these tox@@ ins when we die ?
but this is great fun for children .
we were talking about the ra@@ p@@ ture ? it &apos;s coming .
do you mind if we do something completely different ?
so we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a techni@@ que that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
we have to make the right moral decision .
so i had a really quite happy life at indi@@ ana .
god bl@@ ess .
we &apos;re very used to this .
and then i swa@@ p it out with the students and actually re-@@ rele@@ ase that carbon black .
and you &apos;re getting all kinds of cool stuff .
this is a 15 year-old boy .
these are survival skills .
za@@ in@@ ab sal@@ bi : women , war@@ time and the dream of peace
the first gentle@@ man , he &apos;s a bak@@ er .
i go back to color all the time .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
and asia could have social development before they got the economic development .
you &apos;re going to tell me it &apos;s wa@@ ste@@ ful .
in that 10 to 15 minutes , all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the bl@@ ast .
it &apos;s focus and pres@@ ence .
and this energy , according to einstein , exer@@ ts a push on the universe .
remember , i &apos;m somebody who said that i speak flu@@ ent japanese and i know ja@@ vas@@ cri@@ pt and i was okay with that .
it &apos;s very powerful work .
so you go to the liter@@ ature .
but i also don &apos;t understand how it does ru@@ in the magic .
that &apos;s it without the case on .
but in the last two decades , it has experienced an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented expan@@ sion , now accoun@@ ting for roughly 15 percent of the world &apos;s g@@ dp .
i brought my scientific colleagues and sustain@@ ability prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers into the prison .
he &apos;s dying .
it changed my life .
that &apos;s our average budget .
in fact , they &apos;ve accoun@@ ted for half of all civil wars .
art is the ulti@@ mate goal .
and a little kid from the back was like this .
it &apos;s such a huge subject . &quot;
one person w@@ ins .
all it takes is for a super@@ no@@ va to go off a few light years away , and we &apos;ll all be dead !
there were no cars , so it seemed even better , in some ways .
and into that fer@@ ment came the micro@@ process@@ or .
so the fis@@ her@@ men are cat@@ ching more .
he would tell you , &quot; i &apos;m a colle@@ ctor , and i cu@@ rate a museum . &quot;
and then what comes out of it ? new life .
my dad said , &quot; that &apos;s one , &quot; and i still didn &apos;t let that go .
the foot is distribu@@ ted along the whole leg .
so we need to start getting better .
this was a great thing .
this is the vi@@ bri@@ o fis@@ cher@@ i molecule .
so , this is an a@@ sto@@ unding table .
then we asked them , &quot; how much would you pay for george clo@@ on@@ ey &apos;s swe@@ ater ? &quot;
but how about the kid on the left , or the ath@@ le@@ te that leaves the field of play ?
it was three days , four me@@ als .
then , you &apos;ve got to , you know , face potential public ridi@@ cule of -- that &apos;s a crazy idea , it &apos;ll never work .
he was obs@@ essed .
and often it does something more .
now i can divi@@ de my spo@@ ken word journey into three steps .
let &apos;s start with business .
i am a neuro@@ scientist with a mix@@ ed background in physics and medicine .
this came in , like , six different colors .
this is about my friend brenn@@ an .
don &apos;t worry about the numbers .
what happens to matter if you cho@@ p it up very fine ?
now , you have all been at a m@@ all during the ho@@ li@@ days , yes ?
so there are up to a million people there everyday .
again , this is no m@@ ere hypo@@ the@@ tical .
the rules are my@@ sti@@ fying .
so it goes in and it sta@@ ys there .
it was the expec@@ tation of the citizens that she would not be cen@@ sor@@ ed .
do you remember the story of o@@ dy@@ s@@ se@@ us and the si@@ r@@ ens from high school or j@@ uni@@ or high school ?
so now you put the two things together .
it &apos;s bad enough on a high@@ way , what &apos;s it going to be like to be in the air ?
and i like that kind of response .
&quot; learn the l@@ ingu@@ a fran@@ ca . &quot;
in fact , that &apos;s old hat for cro@@ ws .
but even as a child , i could feel the hea@@ v@@ iness in their he@@ arts .
and so one time i was in a beauty sal@@ on , and i was trying to decide between two very light sha@@ des of p@@ ink .
what will we find as we map the living world , as , finally , we get this under@@ way seriously ?
there &apos;s many of them up there .
in spi@@ te of the very clear anti-@@ isra@@ el@@ i ide@@ ology of the new regi@@ me , the ge@@ o@@ political lo@@ gic for their collaboration lived on , because they still had common thre@@ ats .
i am not making this up .
in north korea , i made it myself .
here it &apos;s &quot; c@@ and@@ y@@ city . &quot;
but electricity also will go in all direc@@ tions -- the path of least resi@@ stance , which is where that phr@@ ase , in part , comes from .
and my country reli@@ es on its security through military alli@@ ance , that &apos;s clear .
but it &apos;s the greatest trans@@ fer of wealth , from one group to another in the history of man@@ kind .
now is there any alternative to this ?
i just put this inside this .
there &apos;s the continent africa .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
and we are vulnerable .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
so they sna@@ pped into action .
that pul@@ ls in more material and pul@@ ls in more material .
people really can learn a language with it .
this was how computing began .
half the city was dark because of a power cut , and i was living on the dark side .
and it &apos;s also just getting to the essential of things .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fing@@ ered speech .
and it &apos;s aw@@ fully win@@ dy over there .
every do@@ t is a person .
ad@@ g : in per@@ su@@ ading them .
they could tra@@ p the flies , send them to him in per@@ th .
h@@ c : so this is where we step into the future and we le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g ahead .
and fro@@ g mode .
that is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
you see the holding patterns that start to develop in the bottom of the screen .
so the very definition -- to say &quot; invest in africa &quot; is a no@@ -@@ go .
or maybe your bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming .
kal@@ lik@@ upp@@ am had caught up with my control school in new del@@ hi , a rich private school with a trained biot@@ echn@@ ology teacher .
they work under the teacher &apos;s gui@@ de , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
i would like to share with you this .
it will be completely free , and it will work in any brow@@ ser .
our school would show bill n@@ ye the science guy .
it &apos;s completely fu@@ cked up and can only be expla@@ ined in song .
she &apos;s highly ath@@ le@@ tic .
for the first time in history , more people live in urban , rather than rural , environments .
so let &apos;s compare the old world with the new world .
watch the mental work@@ load , and watch the ste@@ ering .
