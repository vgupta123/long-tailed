he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
and it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electr@@ onic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
if i give a woman with breast cancer a drug called tax@@ ol every three weeks , which is the standard , about 40 percent of women with meta@@ sta@@ tic cancer have a great response to that drug .
and when they produce their cro@@ ps , they sell the sur@@ plus on market@@ places .
you know , they &apos;re not going to change just out of no@@ where .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be lo@@ y@@ al to it .
and what looks like two big he@@ ap@@ s of leaves , is actually two single leaves that get sh@@ red@@ ded up by the har@@ sh desert conditions over time .
so what i &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main fe@@ atures of my discipl@@ ine -- evi@@ den@@ ce-@@ based medicine .
a set of people actually say , &quot; oh , let me just gr@@ ant it to them , and run away from it . &quot;
from the moment that our ancestors , perhaps two and a half million years ago or so , began im@@ it@@ ating , there was a new cop@@ ying process .
we can turn the volu@@ me up a little bit if that &apos;s available .
you don &apos;t want to share a need@@ le anymore than you want to share a to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush even with someone you &apos;re sle@@ eping with .
yeah , re@@ tail therapy might help .
now , how do you make people own the problem , want to do something about it ?
and this one , look how it sli@@ des si@@ de@@ ways , every which way ?
now what did i learn from this case ? well , three things .
so here i have , actually -- i know exactly where the cards are .
the system was designed to aug@@ ment human intelligence , it was called .
as one gets older ? very , very common .
whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; c@@ at &#93; .
this is a laun@@ dry ch@@ ute , and this right here is a sho@@ e last .
well , he said , &quot; can &apos;t we try a course of electro@@ sho@@ ck therapy ? &quot;
we did not imagine that there would be this many maps around the world .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ or@@ a .
j well , because these sort of things reve@@ al what the true state of , say , arab governments are like , the true human@@ -@@ rights ab@@ uses in those governments .
&quot; if you give the nets for free , people are not going to value them .
he read 30 years of harvard business re@@ view before st@@ um@@ bling upon an article in 198@@ 6 called &quot; the new new product development game . &quot;
but i &apos;m actually here today to tell a story .
politicians in a big , complex , sophisti@@ cated i@@ .@@ t@@ . project ?
but we &apos;re not using it . it &apos;s just sitting there .
this shift is the most stri@@ king in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
some days i put the people in their places at the table , b@@ end their legs at the k@@ ne@@ es , if they come with that fe@@ ature , and fix them into the tiny woo@@ den cha@@ irs .
it &apos;s very hard to measure because there are mix@@ ed mo@@ tives .
and this is a tea@@ po@@ t i designed for al@@ ess@@ i .
there are never any lights there , except the lights that we bring .
that &apos;s when research fun@@ ctions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
now , i don &apos;t know if any of you get u.s. news and world report -- i got the recent issue .
british sex@@ ologist ro@@ y le@@ v@@ in has spe@@ cul@@ ated that this is perhaps why men evolved to be such enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic and frequ@@ ent ma@@ stur@@ bat@@ ors .
this is even a more interesting solution in se@@ ou@@ l , korea .
when i li@@ ft the hea@@ p , i pe@@ ek .
it is a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ win situation that starts the food economy moving .
but anyway , i got my su@@ it@@ case of ir@@ on ore and dra@@ g@@ ged it back to london on the train , and then was fac@@ ed with the problem : okay , how do you make this rock into components for a to@@ aster ?
couldn &apos;t do it . could not wait .
it &apos;s not because we &apos;re going to build a ba@@ j@@ il@@ li@@ on wind@@ mil@@ ls .
i think that &apos;s got to be sc@@ aring a lot of animals away .
and so the back@@ story of the 99 takes place in 12@@ 5@@ 8 , which history tells us the mon@@ g@@ ols inv@@ aded bag@@ h@@ dad and destro@@ yed it .
you can actually see , right here , it will vi@@ bra@@ te .
i &apos;m actually here to make a challenge to people .
and &quot; would &quot; is co@@ co chan@@ el &apos;s lo@@ ver , &quot; should &quot; is edi@@ th si@@ t@@ well , and &quot; could &quot; is an aug@@ ust s@@ ander subject .
this is my office . it &apos;s out there .
and i know what you &apos;re all thinking about are do@@ d@@ geb@@ all teams .
in our first year , the first net went off the line in oc@@ tober of 2003 .
each one is like a sun with a re@@ tin@@ ue of planets or@@ bit@@ ing around it .
then , if in that frame@@ work , you take a bunch of theore@@ ti@@ cians .
7@@ 22 is 500 -- o@@ oh , that &apos;s a harder one .
that &apos;s what &apos;s in fields around the world every single year .
and this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive cultural adap@@ tation , as anthropo@@ logi@@ sts call this accu@@ mu@@ lation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bu@@ st@@ ling and te@@ em@@ ing everyday lives .
and there &apos;s this famous example of one that was 1,@@ 200 feet long and la@@ sted for two days , and the ants just kept mar@@ ching around and around in a circle until they died .
and that &apos;s how this was done . it &apos;s actually sli@@ ce , sli@@ ce .
but then , when i thought about it beyond that , it was very simple things .
so there are lots of examples like this that we talk about .
and we cho@@ se to use the pres@@ cri@@ ption for that purpose .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , r@@ na inter@@ ference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental compon@@ ent of how cells work .
open your hand . thank you very much .
we hope to have that built this fall .
but they can show you how to build things in sequence .
and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
but what we have is a perception problem because not enough people really get it yet .
when people don &apos;t take their p@@ ills , when people don &apos;t follow doctors &apos; orders -- these are behavior problems .
you could just hang it as a bed she@@ et , but again , the compu@@ tation of all the physics gives you the a@@ ero@@ dynamic shape .
they want order , even at some cost to those at the bottom .
we &apos;re now , instead of shi@@ pping a product across the world , we &apos;re sending data across the internet .
it was phenomen@@ al , and we felt gr@@ ate@@ ful that she tru@@ sted us to that ex@@ tent .
this institution is govern@@ ment@@ -@@ bac@@ ked and it has been the case for the past three decades .
these films held what was too hur@@ t@@ ful to say out l@@ oud , and they became more useful to me than the wh@@ is@@ pers of survi@@ vor@@ s and the occasi@@ onal gli@@ mp@@ se of a tat@@ too on a ma@@ i@@ den a@@ unt &apos;s wr@@ ist .
hon@@ est@@ ly , better or worse ? say , &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
i played with it for a while , and i made it return to the orig@@ in .
but what seems so slow and gra@@ ce@@ ful from the outside is really more like chaos inside , because cells control their shape with a skelet@@ on of ri@@ gi@@ d protein fi@@ bers , and those fi@@ bers are constantly fall@@ ing apart .
our goal over the next year is to get water can@@ ary ready for the field and to open-@@ source the hard@@ ware so that anyone can contribu@@ te to the development and the ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we can t@@ ack@@ le this problem together .
have got these sur@@ ve@@ ys in place in their dat@@ ab@@ ase , then they use advanced mathematical for@@ mul@@ as to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
this is a work , a library i designed for the ro@@ bin hood foundation .
go one step up , and you get to farmers , who throw away sometimes a third or even more of their harv@@ est because of co@@ s@@ me@@ tic standards .
look , the world has changed from anal@@ o@@ g to digital .
so , you &apos;re putting in less ju@@ ice , and therefore the out@@ come : fewer puzz@@ les solved .
yes , ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling -- i ins@@ ist on that .
febru@@ ary 4@@ th , we po@@ sted it on our website . this was before super tu@@ es@@ day .
but -- oh , they &apos;re also working on hiv / aids .
and an early test which argument e@@ lic@@ ited co@@ oper@@ ative behavior from the people below -- about a hundred to one decided that this was the argument that worked best on us .
for those of you who remember your physics , that &apos;s a zer@@ o-@@ ang@@ ul@@ ar-@@ moment@@ um ri@@ gh@@ ting response . but it &apos;s like a c@@ at .
they are sk@@ ating . they are doing street plays .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call &quot; pac@@ k@@ aging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
and so now we can look one degrees , two degrees , three degrees away from that no@@ de and elimin@@ ate three-@@ quar@@ ters of the diagra@@ m outside that sphere of influence .
and in this space between me and the other lies the ero@@ tic Ã©@@ lan , lies that movement toward the other .
i set up a studio and i tried to get published .
i wanted to learn to co@@ ok , and she kept me in the kitchen , cutting , cu@@ bing and ch@@ opp@@ ing for a whole month .
of course , sea cu@@ cum@@ bers sho@@ ot them out their re@@ ars , which , in my opini@@ on , makes them much more interesting a super@@ hero .
now i know that some of you think this progress is all in asia or la@@ tin america or model countries like brazil -- and who doesn &apos;t love a brazi@@ li@@ an model ? -- but look at sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
you can show a mo@@ squ@@ e , or you can show wor@@ shi@@ p@@ pers , but there &apos;s not a stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward way of de@@ pic@@ ting islam .
that &apos;s a degree of an impro@@ vement that would look good on your report card , okay ?
half of them deser@@ ted to go look for gold .
if you give me a 7@@ 4@@ 7 , i &apos;ll make six me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts , which is more than the largest wind tur@@ bin@@ es today .
in this map from mol@@ do@@ va , the green color shows those distri@@ cts that have low spending on schools but good edu@@ cational out@@ comes , and the red color shows the opposite .
it actually takes a little longer . it takes five days .
and then from there , you &apos;ve got to take them on a very soli@@ d , ste@@ ad@@ y , up@@ ward path , right from beginning to end .
bf : ten years to perfect , which you &apos;re about to see .
now , there &apos;s a typical scientific journ@@ al , the quar@@ ter@@ ly re@@ view of biology .
the defin@@ ing factor is never resources ; it &apos;s resour@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
b@@ l : this is the ep@@ it@@ ome of technology . right . okay .
if you take a clo@@ se@@ -up of those , they look like this .
and it is in fact due to this arms race between ha@@ ck@@ ers and operating system designers that things go back and forth .
so , this is normal dna , what you think of as normal dna .
those are things that are different for each m@@ .@@ s. patient .
it is fin@@ ite ; harmon@@ y is infin@@ ite .
and quite frank@@ ly , i think if col@@ on@@ el s@@ anders was to be care@@ ful how he wor@@ ded it , he could actually adverti@@ se an extra piece .
we expla@@ ined we would have number three ma@@ iled to them .
it &apos;s been all about these kind of thou@@ ght@@ less things that people do , which have huge inten@@ tion and huge opportunity .
and what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quar@@ ters of the world going to do ?
and the cor@@ relation , of course , is that den@@ ser places tend to have lower emissions -- which isn &apos;t really all that difficult to figure out , if you think about it .
so what i &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
now -- -- one guy laugh@@ ed . so now , to find the queen , do it this way : take back the other one , take back the queen .
but the history books and the daily news tell us it doesn &apos;t always work out that way .
the du@@ tch are good also , but the itali@@ ans are good .
but , it &apos;s more complicated . it &apos;s not that simple , and you have to work with the people .
your new jo@@ int vent@@ ure partner might sha@@ ke your hand , celebra@@ te , go out to dinner with you and then lea@@ k an expression of an@@ ger .
they recognize : both of these things have to live together .
they &apos;re beauti@@ fully designed , simple to use and user friend@@ ly .
there has never been a company that doesn &apos;t have competition .
she had been asked by one of the cli@@ ents to go to the home of the cli@@ ent , because the cli@@ ent wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and si@@ sters about her hiv status , and she was afraid to go by her@@ self .
there is more of it than you think , actually .
richard pre@@ ston , thank you very much , i think .
this is one of the reasons why canada , origin@@ ally a climate change hero -- we were one of the first sig@@ nat@@ ories of the k@@ yo@@ to accor@@ d .
and so in 199@@ 7 , i said , &quot; let &apos;s get women together .
so that &apos;s open-@@ source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of freedom of information law .
because what i &apos;m obser@@ ving is the good teachers , for a lot of these kids , are out in the community colle@@ ges , but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
they run google ads , and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know .
they worked out they were worth two billion pounds .
i love paper , and i love technology , and what i do is i make paper inter@@ active .
and this was colle@@ cted by an@@ ap@@ um -- which is like , finally in the end , he will not have anything , because it will ev@@ apo@@ rate .
and when i made my way to that pi@@ ping ch@@ im@@ ney i &apos;d seen in the distance , i saw han@@ na za@@ vor@@ ot@@ n@@ ya , and i met her .
this is the size of the &quot; little boy &quot; bom@@ b that was dro@@ pped at hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma .
i don &apos;t deser@@ ve it . i don &apos;t deser@@ ve anything .
so , again , we were asked to design a water pu@@ mp for a company called ap@@ prote@@ c , in kenya .
that &apos;s ban@@ ned now , and that &apos;ll be good news for the sharks .
it &apos;s a story that lives deep in my heart , and i &apos;m proud to share this with you .
it &apos;s that shape because the heli@@ um has to exp@@ and .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to do nice carto@@ ons .
and then it started , there was no turning back after that .
you can send them inside buildings like this as first respon@@ ders to look for in@@ tru@@ ders , maybe look for bio@@ chemical lea@@ ks , gas@@ e@@ ous lea@@ ks .
once you &apos;ve made it , the instal@@ lation &apos;s quite easy .
now , it &apos;s no surprise that when you add con@@ se@@ cu@@ tive fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i numbers , you get the next fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i number . right ?
ladies and gentle@@ men , this story has not yet been published .
with that , i have to ada@@ pt to something new .
and when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
animals might love to play , but they don &apos;t love to watch .
i truly believe it &apos;s where dig@@ ni@@ ty starts .
and then i &apos;m going to show you it &apos;s actually a lot more complicated .
but it &apos;s also clear that pro@@ sper@@ ity goes beyond this .
and then we have the radio waves , they have the issues i &apos;ve just mentioned .
it may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as i said , human rights in bur@@ ma .
for me , this kind of person@@ i@@ fi@@ es this connected world , where everything is inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed , and the dots are -- it &apos;s all about the dots jo@@ ining together .
and the dan@@ ger is that they can cause roughly what &apos;s a pan@@ de@@ mic .
multi@@ p@@ ly 22 times 4@@ 7 , make sure you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 , or the calcul@@ ators are not working . do all of you get 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ? 1,@@ 0@@ 3@@ 4 ?
and i &apos;m sure there are people here who probably know better than i do about effici@@ en@@ cies , but i can &apos;t imagine that every a@@ partment having its own air condi@@ tion@@ er is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale .
while young people seem to be very sure about their participa@@ tion in public poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
they were interested in health ; they were interested in education .
this is what they think about my site ; it &apos;s ran@@ ked by blog auth@@ ority .
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , ro@@ sie .
they made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bom@@ b to end the whole thing , right ?
and again , i felt kind of un@@ comfortable with the notion that a building the size of the washington building -- 5@@ 0,000 square feet -- will sit on that fra@@ gi@@ le h@@ ill and that we will go into g@@ aller@@ ies -- rooms with do@@ ors and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st .
so if you don &apos;t know one of these languages , it &apos;s inst@@ ant learning .
i would like to tell you a story conne@@ cting the not@@ ori@@ ous priv@@ acy inci@@ dent invol@@ ving adam and e@@ ve , and the remarkable shift in the boundar@@ ies between public and private which has occur@@ red in the past 10 years .
the old story about climate protection is that it &apos;s co@@ stly , or it would have been done already .
a lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
so again , the un@@ expected which is also the ra@@ w .
so if we &apos;re married , we &apos;re more likely to have kids .
is this a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ year , a stor@@ y-@@ of-@@ the-@@ decade or something more ?
look at that beautiful thing ch@@ ih@@ o showed us . she sc@@ ared us with the la@@ va man .
so , i decided over the years , because of a series of experiments that this is because of context and architecture .
when they say to you , &quot; what do you do ? &quot; -- you say , &quot; i &apos;m a statisti@@ cian . &quot;
therefore , if we can find the right cells and im@@ plant them in the body , they may do the heal@@ ing .
then i would go up and deliver them to these 7@@ 0-@@ year-old women playing bridge .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
they need to be alive , they need to feed .
and that somehow , predi@@ ction leads to intelligent behavior .
we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground .
if everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
i would also like to pay ho@@ ma@@ ge and honor to the ted fel@@ lo@@ ws jun@@ e ar@@ ung@@ a , james shi@@ k@@ wat@@ i , andre@@ w , and the other ted fel@@ lo@@ ws .
so the robot is obviously capable of ex@@ ecu@@ ting any cur@@ ve tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
this bacteria was discovered several years ago by a team of planet@@ ary bi@@ ologists hop@@ ing to find clu@@ es to life on other planets by looking at one of the har@@ sh@@ est conditions on ours .
the schools need you . the teachers need you .
and then they bl@@ ame the ban@@ ks for being the bad guys who gave them the mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages .
and what i do is i look for simil@@ ari@@ ties and differences in the solutions that they &apos;ve evolved for fundamental biological problems .
we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s had a lot of st@@ res@@ ses and a lot of problems to begin with .
and keep going , until the subject pres@@ ses the butt@@ on , saying , &quot; i see the change . &quot;
so a few years ago , l@@ .@@ a. coun@@ ty decided that they needed to spend 2.@@ 5 billion dollars to re@@ pair the city schools .
so en@@ vision what it looks like all wra@@ pped up .
actually , that was ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le &apos;s answer too .
this graph that i &apos;m cli@@ cking down here is meant to be remin@@ is@@ cent of a medical he@@ art@@ beat graph , showing the exciting moments of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine .
i remember one time i was doing it , and the window was open .
and so i was sitting in this restaurant , waiting for a man to come by who obviously would have some diffic@@ ul@@ ty ...
i didn &apos;t want them to be over@@ ly thre@@ at@@ ening or sc@@ ary .
well three sons got into a negoti@@ ation .
everyone was gl@@ u@@ ed to the tv , watching dist@@ ur@@ bing , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
in the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro@@ -@@ vac@@ cin@@ ology to make a pre@@ ven@@ tive flu v@@ acc@@ ine .
now , you see a very interesting pattern here , which is first of all , two things are va@@ stly over@@ -@@ esti@@ ma@@ ted , nam@@ ely tor@@ na@@ does and fire@@ works .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
we look at what &apos;s inside of the person , the bad ap@@ ples .
sent to prison , ad@@ am@@ antly insi@@ sting on his inno@@ c@@ ence , which he has consi@@ st@@ ently for 21 years .
so , it &apos;s sort of related , but you can see it &apos;s much more over@@ tly ero@@ tic .
i want to tell you some stories that explain my view .
this one is one of my favor@@ ites , bel@@ ma@@ r .
being a leader gives you char@@ is@@ ma .
i wrote this one , and i put this up because of einstein today .
it &apos;s amazing . it &apos;s a wonderful moment .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it prop@@ els economic growth more than even technologi@@ cal change itself .
and although i want to thank the tal@@ ented people of our company fore@@ most for that -- and also there &apos;s a factor of lu@@ ck and ti@@ ming -- we are absolutely convinced that we did this because of our values .
they &apos;re even more sho@@ cked by what he says .
people -- for law to be the platform for freedom , people have to trust it .
we explore for three reasons , the we@@ ak@@ est of which is curi@@ osity .
the re@@ ven@@ u@@ es increase at a higher level , giving us a healthy mar@@ g@@ in while you &apos;re tre@@ ating a large number of people for free .
humans y@@ a@@ wn when others y@@ a@@ wn .
well , this is about state bud@@ gets .
and when we drop the ball@@ ast over@@ board we clim@@ b .
so this tri@@ p@@ ty@@ ch , these three pan@@ els portra@@ y the ti@@ mel@@ ess truth that order ten@@ ds to deca@@ y .
so i brought to you for the first time on the ted stage prote@@ i number eight . it &apos;s not the last one , but it &apos;s a good one for making demo@@ s .
the sense of , you know , life could be better , i could join this -- i could be a perfect person , i could join this perfect world .
and they are thought to be able to filter a cu@@ bi@@ c kilometer of water every hour and can feed on 30 kil@@ os of zo@@ o plan@@ k@@ ton a day to survive .
the bad news is they &apos;re ro@@ cket fu@@ els .
they look like , maybe like sun@@ flo@@ wers .
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distin@@ ctive stage .
he never knew his father very well , because his father left his mom while she was preg@@ nant with him .
and then it &apos;s time to do it again . last year .
which leads us to the last one , which is our elec@@ tions .
i was h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to inclu@@ de this in my pres@@ entation because this carto@@ on was published soon after 9 / 11 .
z@@ ambi@@ a-@@ born film@@ maker fran@@ co sac@@ ch@@ i t@@ ours us through n@@ ollywood , nigeria &apos;s bo@@ om@@ ing film industry . gu@@ er@@ ri@@ ll@@ a film@@ making and brilli@@ ance under pressure from cre@@ ws that can sho@@ ot a ful@@ l-@@ l@@ ength fe@@ ature in a week .
so a few examples : we &apos;re now in the era of &quot; fantastic vo@@ y@@ age , &quot; the i@@ p@@ ill .
we have one of these things now . it &apos;s completely cool .
now , what is remarkable is that civil rights in america were achie@@ ved in the 196@@ 0s .
it basically means to be human and to do the right thing .
you get st@@ ressed , you do some medi@@ tation .
i don &apos;t think i &apos;ve ever felt so happy in my entire life .
thank you . j@@ y : thank you .
there are several available on the market , and here you see a few .
and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
it can be worth up to one trillion dollars , being paid in bri@@ bes every year , or equal to india &apos;s g@@ dp .
it can &apos;t afford to dou@@ bt the person who ten@@ ds the child .
you move that up and down with a little bit of energy but now you &apos;re only shif@@ ting the air down to the hot end and up to the cold end , down to the hot end and up to the cold end .
and this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
dh : wow , you &apos;ve been working out .
but maybe if i cut a hole in his head i can fix it . &quot;
i think that really leads no@@ where .
so they take the first one that comes along , often .
and you &apos;ll see there is a line , a fa@@ int line going across that image .
if you &apos;re seeing it as a cu@@ be flo@@ ating in front of some cir@@ cles , some black cir@@ cles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
and if the story is a good one , it might even make us s@@ mile .
so what we found was , when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was low , people were more likely to take re@@ ven@@ ge when they &apos;re treated un@@ fairly .
i &apos;m just going back and forth ; i &apos;m not getting anywhere .
so , if you wanted to get 16 light bul@@ bs , remember , today our total energy consumption is 1@@ 25 light bul@@ bs &apos; worth .
i don &apos;t know if i &apos;ll be able to make this any clear@@ er .
and i was actually a po@@ tent force in spre@@ ading ideas across bor@@ ders , and i wit@@ n@@ essed the rise of islam@@ ist extre@@ mis@@ m as distin@@ ct from islam the faith , and the way in which it influ@@ enced my co-@@ religi@@ oni@@ sts across the world .
actually , that &apos;s a docum@@ ent@@ ary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
when the mission was over , they actually land@@ ed on the thing .
now , cor@@ n origin@@ ated , we think , in mexico .
projects around the world -- docum@@ enting oral poetry in si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , preser@@ ving traditional wea@@ ving patterns in ga@@ za , language re@@ vi@@ tali@@ zation in ta@@ ji@@ ki@@ stan , etc . , etc .
it &apos;s very , very difficult to speak at the end of a conference like this , because everyone has spo@@ ken . everything has been said .
i believe that we all have a vision for healthcare in this country .
en@@ danger@@ ed wh@@ ales are killed every year by ship colli@@ sion , and it &apos;s very important to try to reduce this .
they inst@@ antly knew why they wo@@ ke up in the morning .
us .
the nigeri@@ an film@@ makers really , really , are doing what they like .
so that &apos;s what those great medi@@ tat@@ ors have been doing .
from this pattern , we already know the partic@@ le physics of these tiny sc@@ ales . the way the universe works with these tiny sc@@ ales is very beautiful .
i discovered that there &apos;s a movement for a better way .
a techni@@ cian will put the electro@@ des onto the sc@@ al@@ p using a conduc@@ tive gel or pa@@ ste and usually after a proce@@ d@@ ure of prepar@@ ing the sc@@ al@@ p by light ab@@ r@@ asi@@ on .
and this is a question , i think , which needs to be discus@@ sed carefully .
today , we can write a word such as ted in eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an hier@@ o@@ gl@@ yp@@ hi@@ cs and in c@@ un@@ ei@@ form scri@@ pt , because both of these were deci@@ pher@@ ed in the 19@@ th century .
p@@ ure content and p@@ ure form , side by side .
in fact , he was probably six in@@ ches t@@ aller than me , and she was about this t@@ all .
it &apos;s all about oil ; you know that , everybody knows that .
so we &apos;ve all heard about the am@@ ish giving up cars .
and that means an increase in@@ cen@@ tive to do research and development , which benefits everyone in the world .
so i want to give you a quick story of how it got started .
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technologi@@ cal revolution .
so , i decided that i wanted to investi@@ gate the economics of terror@@ ism .
let me show you a slide here which illu@@ str@@ ates the character of confli@@ cts since 194@@ 6 until today .
it &apos;s good for them . they make a lot of money .
if you &apos;re the second site there , most people link to you .
very od@@ d -- i &apos;ve analy@@ zed this for a while .
and you can win when you &apos;re out@@ sc@@ or@@ ed .
what was actually killing us wasn &apos;t the musli@@ ms , wasn &apos;t the arab@@ s .
there is a basic view that real value invol@@ ves making things , invol@@ ves labor . it invol@@ ves engineering .
it &apos;s very pain@@ ful , even though it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
and my imm@@ un@@ ologist told me that i should also wi@@ pe down all of the remote contro@@ ls and i@@ phones in my house , because those are just or@@ gi@@ es of ger@@ ms .
but every single thing that makes us , every at@@ om in us , has already created a my@@ ri@@ ad of different things and will go on to create a my@@ ri@@ ad of new things .
often what j@@ ams us up is se@@ wa@@ ge .
and this is test on some li@@ p bal@@ ms that we have over here .
i don &apos;t know where juli@@ an mor@@ row got that from .
the effect of this has been that , within the first year , we really had a 40 percent pen@@ et@@ ration in the market that it ser@@ ved , which is over 5@@ 0,000 people .
it had two-@@ to-@@ three-@@ to-@@ 400 times the tox@@ ic lo@@ ads ever allowed by the ep@@ a .
in genom@@ ics now , the genome cost about a billion dollars about 10 years ago when the first one came out .
but there &apos;s also a lot of people that you don &apos;t know .
and he asked that particular person , what do cro@@ ws and fish have in common ?
here is a p@@ est , de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing p@@ est , a spi@@ der mi@@ te , because it does a lot of web@@ bing like a spi@@ der .
and when you &apos;re told this , you feel kind of weird .
our ne@@ west experiment has been hat@@ ched by my collea@@ gue , art ar@@ on -- putting people who are repor@@ ting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the func@@ tional mr@@ i .
it just seems like it &apos;s not sex@@ y and elegan@@ t , it &apos;s hidden .
the no@@ ve@@ list v@@ la@@ di@@ mir n@@ abo@@ ko@@ v said that the best re@@ a@@ der has a combin@@ ation of two very different temper@@ am@@ ents , the arti@@ stic and the scientific .
mil@@ o : i wonder how deep it is .
not ex@@ clu@@ sive to these things , but in addition to them , is pro@@ pag@@ ating a genu@@ ine demand for democracy on the ground .
you &apos;ve got to think , and i &apos;m going to ask you some questions .
and in ways both big and small , the narra@@ tive of the vic@@ tim shapes the way we see women .
so , ai@@ ch@@ a , do you have a couple of words for conclu@@ sion ?
but an@@ ger is like gas@@ ol@@ ine , and if you spra@@ y it around and somebody lights a match , you &apos;ve got an in@@ fer@@ no .
the human goal here was to identify cam@@ ps for rel@@ oc@@ ation based on pri@@ ority need .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
we &apos;re just pac@@ king in colum@@ ns , so that we &apos;d have more ne@@ o@@ cor@@ tical colum@@ ns to per@@ form more complex fun@@ ctions .
there were 5@@ 6 , and when our president wanted to am@@ end the const@@ it@@ ution and re@@ move term limit@@ s , he had to create 25 new distri@@ cts , and now there are 8@@ 1 .
and so we tend to wor@@ ship ourselves .
so when i do my job , people hate me .
and this is a fundamental basic property that we explo@@ it with our technology .
when we looked at their p@@ sa levels -- which is a mar@@ ker for pro@@ state cancer -- they got worse in the control group , but they actually got better in the experiment@@ al group , and these differences were highly significant .
and then we have silk , th@@ ai silk .
so , what &apos;s needed now is to re@@ build these boundar@@ ies .
so there was a time when it was your first time ever hit@@ ting a string of green lights on the way home from work .
and he looked intri@@ gu@@ ed despite himself , and he said , &quot; okay , go on . &quot;
and if it is -- and particularly given the fact that we came very close to extin@@ ction .
you had to measure the milk and add it , mix@@ ing it .
finally , there &apos;s the force of gravity , which inter@@ acts with matter via its mass and sp@@ in .
so , that &apos;s really the goal of my talk , is to a , communicate that moment to you and b , have you leave this s@@ ession a little du@@ mber than when you enter@@ ed .
so we are right now doing some syste@@ matic field tests to basically as@@ certain whether something like this actually makes sense to the as@@ ha wor@@ ker .
you can think of this as the language of thought , or &quot; ment@@ al@@ ese . &quot;
so he was convinced , but , in fact , most people aren &apos;t .
and he said to the guy , &quot; why have you put stuff on the back that no one will ever see ? &quot;
let me show you what you could do right now .
the second reason is that we killed these things .
western countries throw out nearly half of their food , not because it &apos;s ine@@ di@@ ble -- but because it doesn &apos;t look appe@@ aling . tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art del@@ ves into the sho@@ cking data of wa@@ sted food , calling for a more responsible use of global resources .
energy is the key factor here . it changed everything .
for a time that i find to be the most plac@@ id and un@@ event@@ ful hour of the day , four in the morning sure gets an awful lot of bad press -- across a lot of different media from a lot of big names .
we get one from mom , one from dad .
but what might feel just right for that midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged ex@@ ecu@@ tive can be a problem for an ad@@ oles@@ cent who needs to develop fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face relationships .
she went to ju@@ are@@ z to take care of an a@@ il@@ ing a@@ unt , and over the course of it , she began to discover what was happening to the mur@@ dered and disappe@@ ared women of ju@@ are@@ z .
and that &apos;s the case all over the world , as you can see from these stars .
we want to eat , not be e@@ aten by , our food .
but now we try to understand that in terms of the development of a part of their brain called the lim@@ bi@@ c system , so i &apos;m going to show you the lim@@ bi@@ c system in red in the slide behind me , and also on this brain .
let &apos;s have a system where we have ow@@ ner@@ ship of land that is regi@@ ster@@ ed in a government office , that people can ple@@ dge as coll@@ at@@ er@@ al .
they set the pri@@ ces , and i don &apos;t even know .
to this end , i have worked in sugar for ste@@ fan sa@@ g@@ meister , three-@@ time ted speak@@ er .
i see traditional music like a kind of re@@ bel@@ li@@ on , in which people can really speak their voice , especially traditional songs from other parts of the former y@@ u@@ go@@ sla@@ v re@@ public .
this year , that one hospital will give back sight to more than 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 people in tam@@ il na@@ du , india .
red means they &apos;re stuck .
we also have another problem , which is that women face harder choices between professional success and personal ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
so , &quot; i saw many tra@@ ins and also ro@@ de on one .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
this is the world -- there won &apos;t be you as a pilot . and i know the pil@@ ots in the audience aren &apos;t going to like that -- and i &apos;ve had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experi@@ en@@ cing that .
that was cool because then i had re@@ tail out@@ lets .
she said , &quot; change your prof@@ ession . &quot;
not the pain@@ ter , i don &apos;t want to think about the pain@@ ter .
but the shapes match up if i ro@@ tate by a six@@ th of a turn around the point where all the tri@@ an@@ gles meet .
they simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
now over the last century , in developed nations like america , moral debate has es@@ cal@@ ated because we take the hypo@@ the@@ tical seriously , and we also take univer@@ s@@ als seriously and look for logi@@ cal connections .
i set up the type , i prin@@ ted it out on an ep@@ son prin@@ ter with wat@@ er-@@ solu@@ ble ink , ta@@ ped it to the wall and thre@@ w a bu@@ cket of water at it . pre@@ st@@ o !
the full videos are online if you are interested .
these are some pictures vis@@ it@@ ors sent to me .
we live longer . we have access to technology that would have seemed like science fi@@ ction just a few years ago .
any do@@ t can be cli@@ cked and exp@@ and@@ ed . and we see here , &quot; i would just feel so much better if i could cur@@ l up in his arms right now and feel his affe@@ ction for me in the embra@@ ce of his body and the ten@@ der@@ ness of his li@@ ps . &quot;
what might ? i believe that what might solve the problem is infrastructure .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
so what you see here is a sub@@ tra@@ ction of areas in which there &apos;s more brain activity when you &apos;re playing people compared to playing the computer .
i remember one night when someone ph@@ oned me on my cell@@ phone -- ordinary person who i don &apos;t know -- from ta@@ hri@@ r square .
and to take that even further , this is a heart .
but really , really natural so@@ ver@@ eig@@ n@@ ty was good for japan .
so there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , shou@@ ting and showing off in front of the security forces .
that &apos;s a potential scen@@ ari@@ o if we fail to take this seriously .
that hor@@ n-@@ sha@@ ped region is what we call the swe@@ et spot .
another time , after m@@ in had already left the hand@@ bag factory , her yo@@ unger sister came to visit , bringing two co@@ ach sig@@ nature hand@@ bag@@ s as gif@@ ts .
but even in this con@@ cer@@ tin@@ a@@ ed co@@ s@@ mic perspective , our century is very , very special , the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet .
so as far as popul@@ ar@@ ity of games , what do you think these people are doing here ?
we &apos;re understanding the software programs that make our body run .
but i get a lot of toi@@ lets , and so you just dis@@ pat@@ ch a toi@@ let with a ham@@ mer , and then you have l@@ um@@ p@@ y ti@@ les .
and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
i know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures .
and when we gave them a battery , and a piece of wire , and a bul@@ b , and said , &quot; can you do it ? &quot; they couldn &apos;t do it . right ?
so much has that happened that i &apos;ve developed a fairly pra@@ tic@@ ed response , which is : i point out that first of all , you have to understand that there is no such thing as an in@@ authenti@@ c experience .
they would get dent@@ ures , and if you got dent@@ ures , you weren &apos;t going to be able to eat cor@@ n-@@ on-@@ the-@@ co@@ b , you &apos;ll eat mus@@ h for the rest of your life .
it need not look like this , which is actually the state of the art today .
if you do that , the rest is just pretty much a coast down@@ h@@ ill .
and the night before my fir@@ st-@@ year talk , and the fir@@ st-@@ year talk at prin@@ c@@ et@@ on is a 20@@ -@@ minute talk to 20 people . that &apos;s it .
i wanted to live a life that i could be proud of .
nobody &apos;s ever done it before , so i &apos;m going to go do it .
ladies and gentle@@ men , i &apos;d like to end before time .
i put the bad pictures up too , because there are bad pictures .
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3@@ .@@ 3 million years , but the labor was very long .
so this is a time of great fl@@ our@@ ishing , and the more i look around , the more convinced i become that this quote , from the physi@@ c@@ ist free@@ man dy@@ son , is not hyper@@ bo@@ le at all .
we don &apos;t really believe in c@@ ameras to do things in homes .
and also , what the anti@@ bodies use is a hand@@ le to essentially gra@@ b and neu@@ tr@@ alize the virus .
i don &apos;t want them to be te@@ ased at school by the other students . &quot;
they think a pun@@ ish@@ ment is something na@@ sty .
so we know , for instance , that music is almost always the last thing that people with advanced alzheimer &apos;s can still respond to .
so , the house is no longer su@@ it@@ able for invasi@@ on .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horri@@ ble micro@@ bi@@ al age .
some of them are par@@ tially imple@@ mented already , the ones at the top .
now , it just shouldn &apos;t take these sorts of eff@@ or@@ ts to find out where the money in de@@ als like this went .
those are very important , cri@@ tically important to us .
however , only recently , due to several technologi@@ cal advan@@ c@@ ements , we are now able to demon@@ strate to you quant@@ um le@@ vi@@ tation and quant@@ um lo@@ cking .
i became the cap@@ tain of the team , and that was great .
when i go out to direct a film , every day we pre@@ p@@ are too much , we think too much .
but small atoms want to join together , small nu@@ cle@@ i want to join together to make bigger ones to go towards ir@@ on .
but they have no in@@ cen@@ tive to do so .
can you imagine what you would feel if you were in my shoes ?
and so we got to the gra@@ ve and made this , which was hil@@ ari@@ ous -- the attention that we got .
but that &apos;s what we &apos;re limited to , at the moment .
it was a rand@@ om@@ i@@ zed control study published in the lan@@ c@@ et .
this is our body wisdom . it &apos;s not something that is medi@@ ated by our language . our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
if this woman has to carry water on her head for miles and miles and miles , you cannot be cele@@ br@@ ating that .
as you can see , it &apos;s blo@@ cking her vision .
the problem is that , in cancer , there isn &apos;t something else that &apos;s inside of you .
bru@@ ce a@@ yl@@ ward : o@@ ops . j@@ on , polio &apos;s almost been er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated .
i just got this impres@@ sion that the money would work .
so it consi@@ sts of two parts , what we call an en@@ co@@ der and a trans@@ duc@@ er .
so here we have lu@@ d@@ ot@@ ru@@ ck , which is in l@@ .@@ a. , doing the things that g@@ our@@ met food tru@@ cks do , and they &apos;ve gather@@ ed quite a following .
many of them are working in deeply in@@ tra@@ c@@ table systems -- the military , con@@ gress , the education system , etc .
it was a way of lo@@ c@@ ating myself .
so let &apos;s try asking a question , like a health related question .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s like . and you would never know .
it &apos;s not the only place we had any interven@@ tions .
the idea goes like this : imagine space is a sub@@ strate of all there is .
and i swa@@ m through the night and i swa@@ m through the next day .
second , multiple long and shor@@ t-@@ term a@@ ims -- 5,000 pi@@ es , bor@@ ing , 15 pi@@ es , interesting .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later : the b@@ ars on this side are higher than the b@@ ars on this side .
what &apos;s more , they are able to walk up@@ right for long di@@ stances .
and then someone else has something the complete opposite of y@@ ours .
it found that over 70 percent of those cases had used anony@@ mous sh@@ ell companies , tot@@ aling almost 5@@ 6 billion dollars .
and even though i &apos;ve only had a brief time to speak , i hope you appreci@@ ate that man@@ na@@ hat@@ ta was a very special place .
dar@@ fu@@ r may have sli@@ pped from the news head@@ lines , but the killing and dis@@ plac@@ ement there continu@@ es as well , and the she@@ er human mis@@ ery that it creates is very hard to fa@@ tho@@ m .
now , we have a ration@@ ale for that .
today , they live in this area , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 5@@ 0,000 to 7@@ 0,000 people , who live in this community of self-@@ built multi-@@ story houses where up to three generations live in one structure .
and that challenge is : how do you do business , how do you trust somebody on the web who you want to do business with when you know that they &apos;re a crimin@@ al ?
these foreign figh@@ ters had left their families in the gul@@ f , the le@@ v@@ ant and north africa to join al q@@ a@@ e@@ da in iraq .
and that has to do with me because in 199@@ 4 , i pac@@ ked a few things into a back@@ pack and head@@ ed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career .
if you go back over the history of ancient war@@ f@@ are , you will find time and time again that sl@@ ing@@ ers were the decisi@@ ve factor against in@@ fan@@ try in one kind of battle or another .
they weren &apos;t willing to engage in this .
so i &apos;m passionate about teaching these fl@@ s skills all over the world .
and we have a high hope in you . thank you very much .
it had become a part of my body , an exten@@ sion of my senses , and after some time , it even became a part of my offi@@ cial image .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
they took longer to re@@ je@@ ct metaph@@ ors as fal@@ se than they did to re@@ je@@ ct literally fal@@ se sent@@ ences .
chromo@@ some one , top left .
so , for example , you can be a pit@@ cher or a cat@@ cher , and that cor@@ respon@@ ds to whether you per@@ form a sexual act or recei@@ ve a sexual act .
to explore that question , we did a study in the boston area where we put one of three interven@@ tions in people &apos;s homes for a period of several weeks .
we have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
st@@ acy sa@@ ger : but for christ@@ ina si@@ de@@ bottom , almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migra@@ ine .
these are the di@@ stances of the tu@@ bes which make it walk that way .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
i designed the process that gener@@ ated the form .
recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public ly@@ n@@ ch@@ ings have been recor@@ ded so far in 2010 in mexico .
i go everywhere to make believe it &apos;s iran .
because mr. ross used to bring in your al@@ bu@@ ms when i was 16 years old in the po@@ tter@@ y class , when the world was all dark , and your music got me to the sun@@ light . &quot;
believe it or not , some of us do survive .
so every idea is basically being suppor@@ ted -- or every it@@ em , or every n@@ ou@@ n -- is being suppor@@ ted by the entire web .
sometimes you got@@ ta lose to win .
so basically i want to ask : what went right and what went wrong in these 50 years when we talk about democracy ?
we don &apos;t have words , really , to describe it yet .
bu@@ ll@@ ying is a disease . pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce is a disease . violence is a disease .
it &apos;s a very logi@@ cal plan , but it was not always like this .
okay , so it causes a small invol@@ un@@ t@@ ary contra@@ ction in my hand by putting a magnetic pul@@ se in my brain .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
a li@@ on having a late night s@@ n@@ ack -- notice he &apos;s got a broken to@@ oth .
and the first one was about a group called the party of god , who wanted to ban val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s day . red was made illegal .
but i told him no , i &apos;m sorry , com@@ promise in colors is gra@@ y , and we have enough gra@@ y to last us a lifetime .
again , not an in@@ san@@ e do@@ se , not an illegal do@@ se , but very much at the high end of normal .
they don &apos;t like it if you come in and want to saw them open and look inside .
but yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; look , you &apos;re going to have to te@@ ar it down .
the first peak , obviously , is the lim@@ b hit@@ ting the load cell .
&quot; spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p project offi@@ cially be@@ gun . job waiting for you . dy@@ son . &quot;
yet , if you analy@@ ze the common man , he or she does not wake up every day and say , &quot; h@@ mm , let me see who i can pay a bri@@ be to today . &quot;
and when she got to the house she was gre@@ et@@ ed .
and now the sh@@ ore is coming , and there &apos;s just a little part of me that &apos;s sad .
don &apos;t be too ag@@ gressi@@ ve , it doesn &apos;t work .
this del@@ u@@ sion is a kind of prison for us , restri@@ cting us to our personal des@@ ires and to affe@@ ction for a few person@@ s ne@@ ar@@ est to us .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
&quot; be the change you want to see in the world , &quot; said ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
i feel that i have dig@@ ni@@ ty that i have lost for so many years . &quot;
and here it is coming up at you , in its first steps up a wall .
and i think that &apos;s a fundament@@ ally interesting question .
you &apos;ve heard of dna ; you probably studied a little bit in biology .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
difficult , e@@ h ? it &apos;s meaning@@ less .
can of wh@@ up ass , the net@@ working force .
and then , of course , there &apos;s climate change , and we all know about climate change .
when he was fit@@ ted , over his extremely m@@ yo@@ pi@@ c eyes , he suddenly looked up and said , &quot; mama , ve@@ o el m@@ un@@ do . &quot;
this is work done by qu@@ enti@@ n lin@@ d@@ sey who &apos;s a graduate student .
on the one hand , he wants to satis@@ fy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social net@@ working .
i came here to speak about ec@@ ology , and i em@@ it@@ ted as much co2 as a fren@@ ch@@ man in one year .
in the s@@ ars epidemic , we learned in h@@ ong kon@@ g that most of trans@@ mission was because people were re@@ moving their mas@@ ks impro@@ per@@ ly .
here &apos;s a film we &apos;ve been hearing things about .
we can also train jud@@ ges so that they find flexi@@ bilities in the law and so that they rule on the side of toler@@ ance rather than pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce .
environmental challenges fall into the same three categ@@ ories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , ha@@ zar@@ d@@ ous waste du@@ mp@@ s . but there are also regi@@ onal environmental problems , like ac@@ id rain from the mid@@ west to the nor@@ the@@ ast , and from western europe to the arc@@ tic , and from the mid@@ west out the miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i into the dead zone of the gul@@ f of mexico .
i designed it to help kids to follow the treatment .
last story here : i &apos;ve got a friend in india who told me that you haven &apos;t really te@@ sted a piece of electr@@ onic technology for distribution in asia until you &apos;ve trained a cock@@ ro@@ ach to clim@@ b in and pe@@ e on every single little compon@@ ent on the inside .
i mean , what are the chan@@ ces that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
okay , we have par@@ ach@@ ute al@@ ig@@ ned .
it &apos;s very tough . it &apos;s very tough .
so that &apos;s great , but again , cheap shot , right ?
i bet those pre@@ histor@@ ic ca@@ ve artists would have loved to know how to draw better .
where &apos;s art ? i got produ@@ c@@ tivity . i got spor@@ ts .
and i believe that . i believe that .
and it was deep . it was deep in my sou@@ l .
and so what we do in the next step is we rele@@ ase one eleph@@ ant before the other , and that eleph@@ ant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rop@@ e -- because if he pul@@ ls at the rop@@ e , it disappe@@ ars and the whole test is over .
right now today , in o@@ sl@@ o as it happens , oil companies are fighting to keep secret their pay@@ ments to governments for extra@@ cting oil in developing countries .
notice also that on all of these graph@@ s , the slo@@ pe is ste@@ e@@ per on in-@@ group , auth@@ ority , pu@@ ri@@ ty .
or you could play many games in one small pat@@ ch of land , even if you didn &apos;t know which game you were actually in .
we put the citi@@ zen first , and not the c@@ ler@@ ks .
let me tell you what i &apos;ve come up with .
and the chinese said to me , &quot; dr. bar@@ nett , you &apos;re absolutely right .
here &apos;s a female that &apos;s in a hur@@ ry . she &apos;s got food .
wait a minute , it &apos;s just in that state , we have a long way to go .
we &apos;d be different , our characters would be different , if our neuro@@ -@@ an@@ atom@@ y and our physi@@ ological chemistry were different .
and turned up the other way , the people who are reti@@ re@@ ment age goes up very , very fast , as the baby bo@@ om@@ ers get to reti@@ re@@ ment age .
i couldn &apos;t believe it , and i &apos;d go around dis@@ se@@ cting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
chri@@ sti@@ en mein@@ der@@ ts@@ ma , auth@@ or of &quot; pi@@ g 0@@ 50@@ 4@@ 9 &quot; looks at the ast@@ on@@ ishing after@@ life of the ordinary pi@@ g , parts of which make their way into at least 18@@ 5 non-@@ por@@ k products , from bul@@ lets to artificial he@@ arts .
now there are other ways the system can be in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited .
the future of these communities is in the people and in our ability to work with those people .
the wir@@ ing from your sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us to those bits is shor@@ ter than the bits that have to pass through the thin@@ ky bit , the cortex .
human demon@@ stra@@ tions , they &apos;re all no@@ is@@ y and im@@ perfect , and we extra@@ ct from them an in@@ fer@@ red task tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory and control sequence for the robot .
we &apos;ve gone through lots of experiences in life , and they provide a strong intuition as to whether an interaction is going to work .
and we thought this was a very interesting com@@ ment on america , and a kind of self-@@ ser@@ ving , &quot; not my responsibility &quot; kind of phenomenon .
so this is writing out the mali@@ cious code , and a few seconds later , on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you &apos;ll see the attac@@ ker &apos;s screen get some interesting new text .
and that &apos;s a perfectly reas@@ on@@ able theory in the sense that almost everything else in biology works by shape .
and if you would , you &apos;ve got a great job .
and that &apos;s clear@@ er now than it &apos;s been for decades .
i talk about un@@ thinking situations all the time .
and that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
so , somebody out there says , &quot; five . &quot;
but it is difficult to hear the words al@@ oud .
somehow she man@@ ages to keep her seven children alive , and a few months later , she gives birth to pre@@ ma@@ ture tw@@ ins .
but the real proje@@ ctions for those ones , i would like to give it like this .
we have students who sit together , black kids and white kids , and what we &apos;ve discovered is you can solve the race problem by creating a world class environment , because people will have a tenden@@ cy to show you world class behavior if you treat them in that way .
and can you send me a bul@@ let ? &quot;
the ge@@ tty here is moving their books to the u@@ cl@@ a , which is where we have one these scan@@ ning centers , and scan@@ ning their out@@ -@@ of-@@ copy@@ right books , which is fab@@ ul@@ ous .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with car@@ bon@@ ated pr@@ une ju@@ ice .
i offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cab@@ in@@ et .
the cause of our trou@@ bles is actually the complexity that science has given us .
and a friend of mine in au@@ stri@@ a felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest cas@@ in@@ o ow@@ ner in lin@@ z into le@@ tting us wra@@ p his building .
in fact , it is said that in the collective consciousness of africa , we get to experience the deep@@ est parts of our own humanity through our inter@@ actions with others .
and people in white hat@@ s sa@@ il@@ ing bo@@ ats .
last month , i was at google , and , boy , that caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a , man .
computers will com@@ bine the sub@@ tle pan@@ -@@ recogni@@ tion power@@ s of human intelligence with ways in which machines are already super@@ ior , in terms of doing analy@@ tic thinking , remem@@ ber@@ ing billions of facts ac@@ cur@@ ately .
when steve sil@@ le@@ tt gets up into a big red@@ wood , he fir@@ es an ar@@ row , which tra@@ ils a fishing line , which gets over a bran@@ ch in the tree , and then you as@@ c@@ end up a rop@@ e which has been dra@@ g@@ ged into the tree by the line .
the structure of el si@@ ste@@ ma is based on a new and flexi@@ ble man@@ aging style adap@@ ted to the fe@@ atures of each community and region , and today atten@@ ds to 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 children of the lower and middle class all over ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela .
i think i have to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye now .
now , it goes down to a. now to g@@ . and then to f .
2005 i did a base jump from the ei@@ ger , from the mon@@ k and from the jung@@ frau , three very famous mountains in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be car@@ ing about recently .
and i went down and ch@@ ie@@ f minister b@@ ad@@ al said to me , &quot; we si@@ k@@ h@@ s have suff@@ ered a great deal , as you have je@@ ws .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hot@@ els , and i &apos;m not married . &quot;
all right , let me then finish off with four general stat@@ ements , an example and two a@@ ph@@ or@@ is@@ ms .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
it will stop because of the end of trade resources .
it kill@@ s me . i &apos;m not kid@@ ding .
this was one of the biggest fac@@ tor@@ ies i &apos;ve ever seen .
this method allows you to use exi@@ sting video@@ dis@@ c materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests .
because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after w@@ inning the lot@@ to , lot@@ tery w@@ inn@@ ers and par@@ ap@@ legi@@ cs are equ@@ ally happy with their lives .
we will fly where the me@@ than@@ e is .
what i &apos;m trying to say is the major contribu@@ tion on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we dep@@ end only on cars , it &apos;s ...
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
the threat is serious , and the time to pre@@ p@@ are for it is now .
this is perhaps the most primi@@ tive sh@@ an@@ ty that you can find in ki@@ ber@@ a , little more than a sti@@ ck@@ -@@ and-@@ mu@@ d hu@@ t next to a g@@ arb@@ age hea@@ p .
p@@ m : so is this a good idea .
i think there &apos;s a kind of meta@@ physical dimension -- that speed becomes a way of w@@ all@@ ing ourselves off from the bigger , deeper questions .
it would be great if the story ended there .
they down@@ lo@@ aded it from dis@@ ne@@ y@@ .com , or one of these web@@ sites , 14 days after putting the computer in their village .
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in den@@ ial . &quot;
so this is the planet that we &apos;ve been playing on up to this point in the game .
so what you see here is 12 separate pe@@ t@@ als , that each could be controlled with individual micro@@ process@@ ors that would only cost a dollar .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero toler@@ ance poli@@ cies .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l wu@@ dun@@ n &apos;s book &quot; half the sky &quot; investi@@ gates the op@@ pres@@ sion of women glob@@ ally . her stories sho@@ ck . only when women in developing countries have equal access to education and economic opportunity will we be using all our human resources .
so what we &apos;re looking for is a perman@@ ent solution .
this was a huge impact on my mind , because i am a woman and i am a mother , and i hadn &apos;t realized that the hiv / aids pan@@ de@@ mic was directly affec@@ ting women in such a way .
and i really loved this idea of the par@@ tial gli@@ mp@@ se into somebody &apos;s life .
now i remember , when he said it , i felt goo@@ se@@ bu@@ mp@@ s on my body , because he said it over@@ looking the mo@@ ab mountains here in the background .
so even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in europe -- without any regu@@ lation , and even without any identi@@ fication on the pac@@ ka@@ ge .
and i can &apos;t have my pos@@ se laugh@@ in &apos; at me .
you should say , &quot; that &apos;s od@@ d . i thought i read that this demo@@ graphic , young men and women in their 20@@ s and 3@@ 0s , is lar@@ gely il@@ liter@@ ate in afghanistan . &quot;
and i think the whole thing ad@@ ds up much better if you do it like this .
i may also be interested in knowing how focused i am , so i can put my level of attention into the circu@@ it board on the other side .
why ? well , we aging bo@@ om@@ ers , baby bo@@ om@@ ers , we &apos;re eating our healthy food , we &apos;re exer@@ cis@@ ing . what about our minds ?
this is terrible , this oil -- it &apos;s in the water .
it &apos;s very interesting . when we started our school the parents would give th@@ um@@ b@@ prin@@ ts in the atten@@ dance regi@@ ster .
as the sky gets dar@@ ker , and the outside air temper@@ atures drop below min@@ us 100 degrees fahr@@ enheit , the most environ@@ ment@@ ally ho@@ sti@@ le se@@ gment of heli@@ os &apos;s journey has gone by without notice , except for being recor@@ ded by speci@@ ally designed data ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion systems and their associated sensor@@ s .
we created the respon@@ sive room where the lights music and blin@@ ds ad@@ ju@@ sted to your state .
but he watched physi@@ ci@@ sts and chemi@@ sts become the pur@@ ve@@ y@@ ors of weapons of mass destruction in the early 20th century .
this is looking directly across the street from where they were standing .
you know , so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really dist@@ ant , but al@@ b@@ eit evolutionary , relative .
you know , you want to make 50 million dollars selling violent video games to kids , go for it .
now it &apos;s lar@@ gely process@@ ed and full of all sorts of addi@@ tives , extra ingre@@ di@@ ents , and you know the rest of the story .
and then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes go@@ li@@ ath to re@@ act to the sight of david .
and you know if you walk across a ch@@ as@@ m , you end up making it worse than if you didn &apos;t start at all -- bigger disaster .
so you have five million , that is , five million auth@@ ors and five million pla@@ inti@@ ff@@ s is a massive law@@ suit .
and i got about two-@@ thir@@ ds of the way through , and there was a ch@@ art on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand side -- on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand page -- that we &apos;ve lab@@ el@@ ed here &quot; the most terri@@ fying ch@@ art imag@@ in@@ able for a new par@@ ent . &quot;
you can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read , what kinds of places they like to travel to , and what kinds of food they like to eat .
it &apos;s all about more , having more .
everyone lives together in this hotel -- lec@@ tur@@ ers and students -- and it &apos;s not surprising at all to find an impro@@ mp@@ tu tu@@ tor@@ ial at 1 a@@ .@@ m .
com@@ promise , if it &apos;s arti@@ stic , if it is able to cop@@ e with its strategi@@ es -- and there is my first sk@@ et@@ ch and the last ren@@ der@@ ing -- it &apos;s not that far away .
it &apos;s more than one device , you know , it &apos;s rene@@ w@@ able .
but , of course , we &apos;ve seen what that does .
the really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &apos;t take these ob@@ ese mi@@ ce and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse &apos;s weight is supposed to be .
but if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
and one of the first vic@@ ti@@ ms of difficult economic times , i think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the fir@@ ing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curi@@ o@@ si@@ t@@ y-@@ led science and exploration .
we &apos;re going to learn how to make one fla@@ p .
you see , it &apos;s not as dra@@ matic as the tsun@@ ami .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ un@@ es , write it to a c@@ d , then ri@@ p the c@@ d to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
in fact , we anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated that star forma@@ tion shouldn &apos;t proce@@ ed in that environment .
so by the year 20@@ 40 , the total process@@ ing of this machine will ex@@ ce@@ ed a total process@@ ing power of humanity , in ra@@ w bits and stuff . and this is , i think , where ray kurz@@ weil and others get this little ch@@ art saying that we &apos;re going to cross .
but you see demo@@ cr@@ ats versus republi@@ can , not a big difference based on who your neighb@@ ors are .
i find a lot of people have diffic@@ ul@@ ty doing that .
it &apos;s a movement that -- it ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates making biot@@ echn@@ ology acc@@ essi@@ ble to everyone , not just scientists and people in government lab@@ s .
there &apos;s a guy on twitter that i know , a health it guy outside boston , and he wrote the e-@@ patient ra@@ p .
it &apos;s ac@@ ou@@ stic vi@@ bra@@ tions in the air , little waves of energy in the air that ti@@ ck@@ le our ear@@ dr@@ um .
and interest@@ ingly , from an identity stand@@ point , what does it mean to have a dis@@ ability ?
so , what do i discover when i look at art@@ works ?
once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness was truly like .
here we have sa@@ van@@ na gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ es , but through evolution we have this forest gi@@ ra@@ ffe that lives only in con@@ go .
like my wish that no one went hun@@ gry or that everything were a free kind of u@@ top@@ ia .
john is one of &#91; about &#93; a do@@ zen very hero@@ ic , coura@@ ge@@ ous people who volunte@@ ered for the study .
we actually think the future &apos;s going to be event@@ -@@ driven .
let me introdu@@ ce you to my brand new project , &quot; b@@ aro@@ que in rock , &quot; which became a golden dis@@ c most recently .
now let &apos;s assu@@ me you go on ho@@ li@@ day .
he went around once , he went around twice , he went around thri@@ ce .
this is what the internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the internet of midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men , mostly midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged white men .
and i often look at things as though they &apos;re food .
i pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cu@@ pol@@ a .
they &apos;re not just possible ; they &apos;re critical .
if we look at construction and manufacturing , there &apos;s major in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies , energy consumption and exc@@ essi@@ ve labor techniques .
it &apos;s certainly what i learned when i was training .
and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together .
they want us to fit in even better .
well , this looks like a picture of virtu@@ ally nothing .
not running from loss , but enter@@ ing g@@ rief , sur@@ ren@@ der@@ ing to sor@@ row .
and i was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
he reach@@ ed down . he pulled a le@@ ver . and the chair s@@ ank down .
so the first one -- the most famous ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment dynamic in the world -- is something called happy hour .
so the goal was to ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ate the target cities .
and on sun@@ day , jun@@ e 14@@ th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;@@ clock in the after@@ noon in sk@@ o@@ wh@@ eg@@ an , ma@@ ine -- this was my a@@ partment there .
but it was the actions , together , of all of us that brought about that change .
thank you for being here .
and every seven sets of seven years , the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are re@@ united and people surro@@ unded with the ones they love .
and that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
so if i were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel un@@ comfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in dro@@ ves .
and some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
but not a big -- for instance , in ze@@ br@@ as , they have a huge ear that &apos;s very mobile , so they can actually turn them both around .
then when you ex@@ it the ima@@ x the@@ at@@ re on the fourth floor -- mostly teen@@ a@@ gers coming out of there -- there &apos;s this big open space that has these tables in it that have inter@@ active games which are quite fun , also designed by dur@@ r@@ ell &#91; bis@@ ho@@ p &#93; and andre@@ w &#91; hir@@ ni@@ ak &#93; of it@@ ch .
girl 6 : like , if you were a girl and you were really ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous and a real big tom@@ boy , you would think that girls &apos; games were kin@@ da s@@ is@@ sy .
and we need to think about how we can do that effectively .
and when they did , they took small@@ po@@ x to 10 other countries and rei@@ gni@@ ted the epidemic .
audience : six . six .
and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these un@@ organized red squ@@ ar@@ es day after day .
and their mission was to find and to destro@@ y -- remember the sc@@ u@@ d mis@@ si@@ le laun@@ chers , those sur@@ fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ air mis@@ si@@ les that the ira@@ q@@ is were laun@@ ching at the isra@@ eli@@ s ?
these things that i photograph@@ ed -- this ti@@ re pi@@ le here had 45 million ti@@ r@@ es in it . it was the largest one .
doctors back then were rou@@ tin@@ ely telling men the importance of pleas@@ uring their wi@@ ves .
you can see that there is &#91; a &#93; sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ing of x-@@ ra@@ ys on the teeth , the metal in the teeth .
i &apos;m here to also tell you that there are lots of shif@@ ts oc@@ curr@@ ing around what china is doing in the democratic stance .
ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
in afghanistan , for example , we haven &apos;t just had one ele@@ ction or two elec@@ tions . we &apos;ve gone through three elec@@ tions , pres@@ identi@@ al and par@@ li@@ am@@ ent@@ ary . and what do we find ?
i realize that &apos;s an ambi@@ gu@@ ous stat@@ ement .
i re@@ jo@@ ice that it &apos;s still in my body .
this was a bad idea , because phili@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don had a son called alex@@ ander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
the view is den@@ i@@ ed in the g@@ aller@@ ies where we recei@@ ve just natural light , and then ex@@ posed again in the north g@@ aller@@ y with a pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic view .
but i was at a ted event recently and es@@ ther du@@ fl@@ o , probably one of the leading experts in , effectively , the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of poverty in the developing world , actually spoke .
many of these dea@@ ths were completely pre@@ vent@@ able , and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ con@@ cer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
so your house is dealing with lea@@ ks all the time , but it &apos;s fix@@ ing them . it &apos;s dra@@ ining them out and so on .
so we percei@@ ve nothing as what it really is .
obviously , i &apos;m having a fab@@ ul@@ ous life , so -- -- the question is , what does all of this mean for you ?
so kids don &apos;t have as hard of a time with this , and i saw in my own son , i gave him this book .
now , this is an example of that battle , and makes us realize inten@@ tions don &apos;t always trans@@ late into action , and so one of the fundamental challenges is how we would actually do that . ok ?
ok , now , do you believe in wit@@ ch@@ craft at all ?
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of top@@ ics , particularly in car@@ dio@@ vas@@ cular disease .
and that &apos;s a back@@ door which will take over your computer .
then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
and , you know , i &apos;m not that better off now .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
maybe you &apos;re ti@@ cked off , or maybe you &apos;re looking forward to a new game . you &apos;ve been up too late playing a game .
even if they did their jobs , and they c@@ ited those facili@@ ties for their viol@@ ations , the fine would be der@@ is@@ ory .
but it turns out that un@@ lo@@ cking the secre@@ ts in the information gener@@ ated by modern experiment@@ al technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisti@@ cated -- you &apos;ll be re@@ lie@@ ved to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisti@@ cated than the head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head story -- but quite sophisti@@ cated computer mod@@ el@@ ings and mathematical mod@@ el@@ ings and modern statisti@@ cal techniques .
it &apos;s too late . that is gone .
it might well be that there are environmental fac@@ tors that we &apos;re not aware of , and it &apos;s pretty likely to be the case that there are genetic fac@@ tors we &apos;re not aware of .
and that , i think , is an idea worth spre@@ ading .
and , as we &apos;ve learned in the last few years , galaxies are held together by the gravi@@ ta@@ tional pull of so-@@ called dark matter : particles in huge s@@ war@@ ms , far smaller even than atom@@ ic nu@@ cle@@ i .
li@@ ck@@ li@@ der for@@ es@@ a@@ w computers doing all the rou@@ tin@@ i@@ z@@ able work that was requi@@ red to pre@@ p@@ are the way for insi@@ ghts and decision making .
this is a heli@@ cop@@ ter medi@@ c giving c@@ p@@ r to a soldi@@ er who had been shot in the head .
the marketing is -- the message for marketing is -- that try to measure what consum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they &apos;ll do or anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te they &apos;ll do .
and that &apos;s gone up since then , but we don &apos;t have the numbers yet .
b@@ j : so , as der@@ e@@ ck says , we have to work through extre@@ mes -- extreme temper@@ atures , push ourselves at night .
at the same time , we need to be really creative in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ ils .
i believe these are the building blocks for future peace .
this is probably the sky@@ line that most of you know about do@@ ha .
more tomorrow . i also have pictures coming of the library for those of you that have asked for pictures .
pretty much everybody else who does po@@ ll@@ s .
now , about that co@@ w model i talked about .
well if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to measure out round colum@@ ns using a rul@@ er .
so , i went back to the computer , and i bought five large fri@@ es , and scan@@ ned them all . and i was looking for some kind of food theme , and i wrote some software to auto@@ matically lay out fren@@ ch@@ -@@ fr@@ y images .
they were living on top of the work@@ sh@@ ops where they were working .
so he figured that out . it took him over two minutes to figure out that he was doing things to the television .
and is art about trying to imagine what lies beyond the hori@@ zon ?
we have shown that there &apos;s little pieces of dna on the specific genes of the mam@@ mary gl@@ and that actually respond to extra@@ cell@@ ular matri@@ x .
whether it &apos;s mathematics or music , it takes that long to be able to begin to change something in a way that it &apos;s better than what was there before .
its le@@ ash had been ti@@ ed to the chair as her master went in for coffee , and she was just per@@ si@@ stent in her eff@@ or@@ ts to gre@@ et me , perhaps get a scrat@@ ch behind the ear .
well , how many bot@@ tles is it before you tell me that i have a problem ?
the sig@@ ns don &apos;t look good , some have said .
and frank@@ ly , i face a big ob@@ stac@@ le .
they were just wo@@ und up doing these things all day long , until the man@@ ager had to , with a stern voice , say , &quot; okay , everybody free@@ ze . &quot;
i &apos;d go to times square and i &apos;d look at the amazing ladies on the wall , and wonder why nobody is looking at the histor@@ ical fig@@ ures just behind them .
i said , &quot; there is a special form of visual hallu@@ cin@@ ation which may go with de@@ teri@@ or@@ ating vision or blin@@ dness .
those ex@@ posed to the world war ii scen@@ ari@@ o made more interven@@ tion@@ ist re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions than the others .
recor@@ ding : okay , here &apos;s something .
i started laugh@@ ing because it got to the point where , was i a writer , or was i a hom@@ eless woman ?
en@@ vy , it &apos;s a real tab@@ o@@ o to mention en@@ vy , but if there is one domin@@ ant emotion in modern society , that is en@@ vy .
parents text and do email at break@@ fast and at dinner while their children com@@ pla@@ in about not having their parents &apos; full attention .
because you &apos;ve agre@@ ed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you poli@@ tely diff@@ er .
i mean , they went to the ma@@ x for this woman .
it is extremely un@@ likely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely un@@ likely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
this is why you can feel such a sense of co@@ s@@ mic union with somebody after you &apos;ve made love to them .
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
what if you had a nose job and you liked it ?
my father tried very hard to motiv@@ ate me into studying , but it didn &apos;t work .
those are then sel@@ ec@@ ted by the algorith@@ m , re@@ produced with mu@@ tation and re@@ combin@@ ations to introdu@@ ce sex as well .
ah , mark -- ser@@ fa@@ as .
and once the soil gets dri@@ ed , you &apos;re in a dry seas@@ on -- you get cra@@ cks , oxygen goes in , fl@@ ames come out and the problem starts all over again .
and this whole list of pages on facebook de@@ dic@@ ated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
let &apos;s see what people here think about it .
in 19@@ 35 , there were 15@@ 0,000 cases a year of malaria in the united states , but dd@@ t and a massive public health effort managed to squ@@ el@@ ch it .
so in australia , &quot; mo &quot; is s@@ lang for mu@@ sta@@ che , so we ren@@ am@@ ed the month of no@@ v@@ ember &quot; mov@@ ember &quot; and created some pretty basic rules , which still stand today .
for one thing , gps doesn &apos;t work in@@ do@@ ors , and for another , they don &apos;t make devices quite this small , especially when those devices have to rela@@ y their measu@@ re@@ ments back over a network .
and i want to begin with one ep@@ iso@@ de from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , bel@@ sha@@ zz@@ ar &apos;s fe@@ ast -- because we &apos;re talking about the ir@@ an-@@ iraq war of 5@@ 3@@ 9 b@@ c .
we discovered blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . we hope you guys will too .
it &apos;s really going to be seven billion pa@@ irs of hands , each following their own passi@@ ons , and each kind of like a mo@@ sa@@ ic coming up and creating this world in their back@@ y@@ ards and in their kit@@ ch@@ ens .
you can have re@@ gener@@ ative bra@@ king ; you can have dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ y-@@ wire ; you can have re@@ plac@@ e@@ able body shapes -- it &apos;s a little thing that starts with a hy@@ bri@@ d , but it can lead to a whole new era of the car .
i love trees , and i &apos;m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arb@@ or@@ et@@ um , and sun@@ days , usually , i &apos;d go there with my wife and now , with my four@@ -year-old , and we &apos;d clim@@ b in the trees , we &apos;d play hi@@ de and se@@ ek .
please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth car@@ ing about and a nation that will be worth defen@@ ding .
he was cri@@ tically ill , there were other cri@@ tically ill patients ; lu@@ ck@@ ily , we were able to get a heli@@ cop@@ ter in to res@@ cu@@ e these guys .
why not ? i think this is rather important .
a cas@@ ual impul@@ se , a fan@@ cy , never thought of until now , har@@ dly thought of even now ...
i come back up , not for air .
i must ad@@ mit , i used to be one of them .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t , like a little brother into a little sister &apos;s room .
i imagine a time not too far from now -- my mom can go to her computer , open up a brow@@ ser and jack into a little robot .
is this a problem ? yes , it &apos;s a big a problem .
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
in fact , someone on re@@ dd@@ it thought , &quot; oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
i need two people to help me out real quick .
i said , &quot; what am i going to say ?
and the later it fa@@ ils , the worse the consequences .
am i understanding you right , that what you &apos;re saying here is that we have in our own bodies a bio@@ chemical response to hydro@@ gen su@@ l@@ fi@@ de that in your mind pro@@ ves that there have been past mass extin@@ ctions due to climate change ?
and dre@@ w bar@@ r@@ y@@ more , for all her wonderful char@@ m , is not glam@@ or@@ ous either .
i mean , i find information just too interesting .
so from pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a to hollywood all the way to modern art in bei@@ j@@ ing , we s@@ mile often , and you s@@ mile to express joy and satis@@ fac@@ tion .
you might wan@@ na a@@ ver@@ t your ga@@ ze , because that is a new@@ t about to re@@ generate its lim@@ b , and sha@@ king hands spre@@ ads more ger@@ ms than k@@ is@@ sing .
and we per@@ si@@ sted , and we got 4@@ 50 guys growing mu@@ sta@@ ches , and together we raised 5@@ 4@@ ,000 dollars , and we don@@ ated every cent of that to the pro@@ state cancer foundation of australia , and that repres@@ ented at the time the single biggest don@@ ation they &apos;d ever received .
char@@ lie le@@ d@@ better , yesterday , i thought , talked very artic@@ ul@@ ately about this need to bring consum@@ ers , to bring people into the process of creating things .
what was interesting about the article was people started comm@@ enting on the article , re@@ a@@ ders of the thing .
stage one is a group where people syste@@ matically se@@ ver relationships from func@@ tional tri@@ bes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
i find this argument fascinating , as though we can kind of b@@ end the rules of physics to suit our needs .
it causes them to di@@ stor@@ t reality .
i wish we had more money , i wish we had more resources .
it &apos;s pretty cool , at least in theory .
there was this equ@@ ation in my family that went something like this : if you are intelligent , you therefore are not spi@@ ritual .
it &apos;s because my mother was den@@ i@@ ed an education , and she constantly remin@@ ded me and my si@@ bl@@ ings that she never wanted us to live the life she was living .
these are the classi@@ c conditions that create re@@ gre@@ t .
now , this might look kind of tri@@ vi@@ al , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any inter@@ active or any virtual worl@@ ds .
this was perhaps the biggest surprise -- how flexi@@ ble the kor@@ an is , at least in minds that are not fundament@@ ally in@@ flexi@@ ble .
but i know i needed to .
&quot; what &apos; tis to love ? &quot; sha@@ k@@ espe@@ are said .
it also helps reduce the risk of the most common can@@ cers like breast , pro@@ state and col@@ on cancer .
a government depen@@ dent upon the people alone .
and like all the dolph@@ ins in our community , we photograph@@ ed mu@@ gs@@ y and tra@@ cked her little spo@@ ts and ni@@ cks in her dor@@ sal f@@ in , and also the unique spot patterns as she ma@@ tured over time .
well , it has its pl@@ uses and min@@ uses .
we are only happy when things are in order .
and the last material i &apos;m going to talk about today is plastic , and , of course , my to@@ aster had to have a plastic case .
and if dinner isn &apos;t entirely obvious , think of sex .
we ten@@ ded towards lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term things and also things that people can re@@ use and make into new movies , which has just been great fun .
and -- oh , i saw gol@@ die ha@@ wn .
but yes there are some solutions .
and look now , the first african countries here are coming in .
they wouldn &apos;t experience re@@ stra@@ in@@ ts as we would . &quot;
instead of trying to pur@@ ge these comm@@ ents , they instead went and reach@@ ed out to the blog@@ gers .
and i believe there &apos;s a way for us to do that .
they were consi@@ st@@ ently du@@ g as li@@ me@@ stone quar@@ ries and by the 18@@ th century , the ca@@ v@@ ing-@@ in of some of these quar@@ ries posed safety thre@@ ats , so the government or@@ dered rein@@ for@@ cing of the exi@@ sting quar@@ ries and du@@ g new obser@@ vation tun@@ n@@ els in order to monit@@ or and map the whole place .
the third one is important because if we think people get used to hand@@ ou@@ ts , it might destro@@ y markets to distribu@@ te free bed nets .
so i had a very inven@@ tive teacher , a paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m , who wanted to teach us about this .
and it turns out that we can measure that very pre@@ cis@@ ely .
so , these are three-@@ po@@ und char@@ ges of c@@ 4 ; that &apos;s about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes .
which takes us to the third reason , why we don &apos;t have many more reser@@ ves , is that the fund@@ ing models have been wrong .
so , now , what i want to do : i &apos;m going to put the middle nine sur@@ faces here under yellow ill@@ um@@ ination by simply putting a filter behind them .
it &apos;s a story that &apos;s a te@@ stam@@ ent to teaching and teachers .
if you don &apos;t believe me , just ask sam .
you know , i don &apos;t know how many of those you read , but it &apos;s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
but fortunately , if you can do this fusion reaction , you &apos;ve got a neu@@ tr@@ on , so you can make that happen .
i got mad . brothers can fight . parents and children can fight .
well , in 2010 , they decided they &apos;re not going to reve@@ al this data anymore , so i had to make some esti@@ mates based on various sources .
do it for fun . no one gets paid a cent , or a eur@@ o or a y@@ en .
all together , they achie@@ ved these results : increas@@ ed the number of people on anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als , life@@ -@@ saving anti-@@ aids drugs ; nearly hal@@ ved dea@@ ths from malaria ; vac@@ cin@@ ated so many that 5@@ .@@ 4 million lives will be saved .
so where this comes into play and why this is important is i head up a technology in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or , and we had eight star@@ tu@@ ps sitting around there .
fourth and final point : he somehow , because he was working in all the world &apos;s worst places and all less@@ er ev@@ ils , had a hu@@ mili@@ ty , of course , and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him .
and especially if you reg@@ ard these two as deep tru@@ ths to live by and to in@@ form your life decisions , then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other .
and the ir@@ ony is that they don &apos;t need to be .
and he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself , and you can see here he &apos;s got zig &apos;s indian reser@@ vation . and this particular shot , this is one of the more traditional sh@@ ots . this is a rain dan@@ cer .
scientists around the world were intri@@ gu@@ ed by this cancer , this infe@@ c@@ tious cancer , that was spre@@ ading through the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil population .
for example , it stimul@@ ates creativity .
so sustain@@ ability is quite important for us , which should in@@ corpo@@ rate social but as well as environmental and economic values .
ok , so that &apos;s the heal@@ ing one .
now i have to tell you , i was talking to k@@ yle last week about this , that i was going to tell this story .
2010 : statistics about na@@ tive population today , more than a century after the mas@@ sac@@ re at wo@@ unded k@@ nee , reve@@ al the leg@@ acy of col@@ oni@@ zation , forced migra@@ tion and treat@@ y viol@@ ations .
now , africa is the most tro@@ pic@@ al continent on the planet -- about 85 percent of it lies between cancer and cap@@ ri@@ cor@@ n -- and there aren &apos;t a lot of gl@@ aci@@ ers here , except on the high mountains here in east africa .
it was when i became a journalist that i really realized how i was part of this problem , and how we all are part of this problem .
my mother says that i started reading at the age of two , although i think four is probably close to the truth .
so , look what they did .
why not ? i mean , that &apos;s what we do .
sometimes they assu@@ me i am dea@@ f .
of course , you and i know that co@@ ke is the better choice .
imagine , with somebody who &apos;s lost their whole arm , we still have four major ner@@ ves that go down your arm .
it &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to ar@@ ise .
hell@@ o governments of rich countries selling arms to governments of poor countries who can &apos;t even afford to give them food .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
this is the straight truth , the ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous truth .
well , it seems to me that this h@@ ung@@ arian pres@@ ence in my life is difficult to account for , but ultimately i as@@ cri@@ be it to an ad@@ mi@@ ration for people with a complex moral awareness , with a her@@ it@@ age of gu@@ il@@ t and de@@ fe@@ at mat@@ ched by de@@ fi@@ ance and bra@@ va@@ do .
the truth be told , i was giving out of that place , not out of a genu@@ ine place of hope and exc@@ it@@ ement to help and of gener@@ osity .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulner@@ abilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
there &apos;s a v@@ et@@ ted press rele@@ ase that you can read -- it &apos;s v@@ et@@ ted by do@@ d -- if you google &quot; stam@@ ets &quot; and &quot; small@@ po@@ x . &quot;
by now , we have now cra@@ w@@ led another four feet , and my mother finally says to me , &quot; i knew it , i knew it .
so , the sad thing is that these chimpanze@@ es -- who &apos;ve perhaps taught us , more than any other cre@@ ature , a little hu@@ mili@@ ty -- are in the wild , disappe@@ aring very fast .
and i think that &apos;s really what architecture is based on .
it &apos;s difficult for them to understand that they &apos;re going to die .
je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os kin@@ dly re@@ mar@@ ked to me , &quot; chris , ted is a really great conference .
you can be pres@@ ent@@ -@@ he@@ don@@ i@@ stic , nam@@ ely you focus on the jo@@ ys of life , or pres@@ ent@@ -@@ f@@ at@@ alist -- it doesn &apos;t matter , your life is controlled .
some have conclu@@ ded that we can only believe in a god who shares our pain .
&quot; u@@ h-@@ hu@@ h ... &quot; she said .
and had such -- it was an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
this is a proud member of prote@@ i from korea , and on the right side , this is a multi@@ ple@@ -@@ ma@@ sts design pro@@ posed by a team in mexico .
but he told ted that on the last day he went out , a bot@@ t@@ len@@ o@@ se dolph@@ in suddenly appe@@ ared next to the boat , and it was sp@@ lat@@ ter@@ ing oil out its blo@@ whole .
i was a young driver out on the high@@ way , and the car in front of me , i saw the bra@@ ke lights go on .
this happens to be ok -- he &apos;s an an@@ atom@@ ically interested little boy and that &apos;s his mom . other situations wouldn &apos;t be quite so good .
and that was lar@@ gely because there weren &apos;t any .
now try and wra@@ p your head around that for a second .
you see , if you can print in metal , you can print one of these , and in fact you can also print one of these too .
but when people learned what her son was acc@@ used of , she didn &apos;t get that sym@@ pathy .
business does not profit from caus@@ ing social problems , actually not in any fundamental sense .
then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set , and ru@@ b it out from the center to the cor@@ ners , like this .
and we tra@@ w@@ l , which means to take something the size of a tra@@ ctor tra@@ il@@ er tru@@ ck that wei@@ gh@@ s thousands and thousands of pounds , put it on a big chain , and dra@@ g it across the sea floor to sti@@ r up the bottom and catch the fish .
and then , we don &apos;t have a stu@@ ff@@ ed spin@@ o@@ za , but we do have a stu@@ ff@@ ed pa@@ v@@ lo@@ v &apos;s dog , and i vis@@ ited him in the museum of hy@@ gi@@ ene in st@@ . pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g , in russi@@ a .
but more or less , this is what will happen , and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divi@@ ded .
this is extremely practical , but not so a@@ wes@@ ome .
biolog@@ ist sh@@ ei@@ la pat@@ ek talks about her work meas@@ uring the fe@@ eding stri@@ ke of the man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp , one of the fa@@ st@@ est mov@@ ements in the animal world , using video c@@ ameras recor@@ ding at 20@@ ,000 fra@@ mes per second .
and it &apos;s focus . nor@@ man je@@ wi@@ son said to me , &quot; i think it all has to do with foc@@ using yourself on one thing . &quot;
so you can imagine how that works .
and finally , some people say , well , you know , i don &apos;t feel like a bunch of cells , you know . i &apos;m conscious .
and yes , she was older to be in fourth grade .
so , a quick stri@@ ke like that . and if we slow it down a bit , this is the man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp -- the same species -- recor@@ ded at 1,000 fra@@ mes a second , played back at 15 fra@@ mes per second .
this under@@ water key@@ board in or@@ land@@ o , florida , at the ep@@ co@@ t center , was actually the most sophisti@@ cated ever two-@@ way interface designed for humans and dolph@@ ins to work together under the water and exchange information .
and then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worl@@ ds -- some of you recognize this young photo of pe@@ te best , who was the original dru@@ mmer for the be@@ at@@ les , until they , you know , sent him out on an er@@ rand and s@@ nu@@ ck away and picked up ring@@ o on a tour .
and here in the united king@@ dom there &apos;s also conc@@ ern over a law called the digital economy act that &apos;s plac@@ ing more on@@ us on private inter@@ medi@@ aries to police citi@@ zen behavior .
their decisions , their actions matter .
and i think about that today because i am remin@@ ded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of clo@@ sing that gap .
and the ga@@ g is that , of course , these aren &apos;t just running through the market .
we &apos;re going to go through four valu@@ e-@@ shif@@ ts that we see driving new consumer behaviors , that offer new management principles .
we managed , but sometimes those hall@@ s didn &apos;t seem exactly su@@ ited to the music i was making or had made .
it &apos;s a secret . the animal effectively clim@@ bs by sli@@ pping and look -- and doing , actually , terri@@ bly , with respect to grab@@ bing on the surface .
but under the surface is a hi@@ ve of industrial activity peri@@ o@@ di@@ cally , this dri@@ ll , like a bi@@ op@@ sy need@@ le , pl@@ ung@@ es thousands of feet deep into the ice to extra@@ ct a mar@@ row of g@@ ases and is@@ ot@@ op@@ es for analysis .
my father , who had f@@ ought in three wars , could not save his own sister from this suffering .
the women &apos;s ch@@ ie@@ f of the village has this little girl , fair color like me , totally dir@@ ty .
in the spin@@ al ward , that &apos;s normal .
in short , the answer is that in the future , in many countries , the col@@ dest growing seas@@ ons are going to be hot@@ ter than anything those cro@@ ps have seen in the past .
so , as we are clim@@ bing the tree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing in order to clim@@ b the tree are actually under@@ min@@ ing the tree &apos;s very ro@@ ot .
but this is the unit of cur@@ ren@@ cy that we &apos;ve taught our mon@@ keys at y@@ ale to actually use with humans , to actually buy different pieces of food .
and it is really not su@@ ited for the future that we &apos;re moving into .
well , a couple of friends and i figured out how to do this .
and when we think about leg@@ acy , i can think of no more powerful one , despite how short her life was .
it is about what we feed them .
maybe these people are right . maybe min@@ d-@@ wander@@ ing is a bad thing .
to put it this way , nature knows no other circum@@ stance in which func@@ tion@@ ally equivalent tra@@ its co@@ exist .
because it told me , by god , one person got it .
let &apos;s take a look at it again . watch the color@@ ation : white on the right , brown on the left .
that is not a for@@ ec@@ ast about how com@@ modi@@ ty pri@@ ces go ; it &apos;s a for@@ ec@@ ast of the consequences , the long-term consequences , for growth of an increase in pri@@ ces .
i won &apos;t demon@@ strate pain behavior , but i can tell you i &apos;m not having any pa@@ ins right now .
and he does manage to find them , but great navi@@ gation skills , l@@ ous@@ y pi@@ ck@@ -up lines .
after these genom@@ es are syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed , the first step is just transplan@@ ting them into a cell without a genome .
instead of blo@@ wing a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e of chil@@ led air through the sta@@ dium , we can use radi@@ ant cool@@ ing technologies , like a floor he@@ ating system where water pi@@ pes are em@@ bed@@ ded in the floor .
and in there he said that cultures tend to s@@ wing between one of two perspe@@ c@@ tives .
and we ad@@ ded three quot@@ ations , because with the first genome we were cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for not trying to say something more profound than just sig@@ ning the work .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
that &apos;s bad , but there are places like that .
there is nothing here that we don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s important that we love babies , and that we not be put off by , say , mess@@ y di@@ a@@ pers .
and i thought it was ast@@ on@@ ishing to spe@@ cu@@ late , as if this were a competition , on something that was such a fresh wo@@ und .
i am an example of what &apos;s possible when girls from the very beginning of their lives are loved and nur@@ tured by the people around them .
i will show income per person on this axis instead , poor down here , rich up there .
the problem is we can &apos;t afford it .
because it &apos;s got all those a &apos;s lin@@ ed up i guess .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spa@@ tial operating environment , we call it .
but then i found out that there were all sorts of pa@@ pers already published that add@@ ressed this top@@ ic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere .
so about seven years , eight years to reach your peak , and then gradu@@ ally you fall off your peak , until you go back to the starting point .
but that &apos;s still not reason for us to dis@@ engage , because we &apos;ve seen that movie before , in afghanistan .
so i -- i took my camera , i took my not@@ e@@ book , took a chair , and started to obser@@ ve this behavior .
and i &apos;m like that &apos;s not ru@@ b@@ ber at all , you know .
many artic@@ les calcu@@ late : how long would it take for this wor@@ ker to work in order to ear@@ n enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
we were up in the mountains , 197@@ 6 .
when i began recor@@ ding in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , the typical metho@@ ds of recor@@ ding were limited to the frag@@ mented capture of individual species like birds mostly , in the beginning , but later animals like ma@@ mm@@ als and am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans .
construction play -- it &apos;s play@@ ful , obviously , but also a powerful way to learn .
s@@ b : you know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
you have my friend , who has a blog on digital -- on p@@ dr@@ s , personal recor@@ ders .
under the reali@@ zation from tour@@ ist oper@@ ators , fis@@ her@@ men , the austr@@ ali@@ an great bar@@ rier re@@ e@@ f auth@@ ority and scientists that the great bar@@ rier re@@ e@@ f is do@@ om@@ ed under the current govern@@ ance regi@@ me .
so &quot; thank you &quot; feel li@@ kes a really tri@@ te word , but thank you from the bottom of my heart for saving my life .
and if you go on the diag@@ onal , you get content and form -- and then beauty and truth .
do you remember the story ? no , it was big .
there &apos;s another sign that we need p@@ it cre@@ ws , and that &apos;s the un@@ mana@@ ge@@ able cost of our care .
these four dri@@ vers are f@@ using together and creating the big shift -- away from the 20th century , defined by hyper@@ -@@ consumption , towards the 21@@ st century , defined by collabor@@ ative consumption .
of course , you got it wrong .
and that ep@@ he@@ mer@@ al nature of the hydro@@ ther@@ mal vent community isn &apos;t really different from some of the areas that i &apos;ve seen in 35 years of travel@@ ing around , making films .
the upp@@ er is n@@ yl@@ on 6 that can go back to ca@@ pro@@ l@@ ac@@ ta@@ m , the bottom , a pol@@ yo@@ le@@ ph@@ ine -- infin@@ itely recycl@@ able ther@@ m@@ op@@ la@@ stic .
well , unfortunately it isn &apos;t really a picture . if i could have my board at the side here , great , exc@@ ell@@ ent .
my work is about the behaviors that we all engage in un@@ consci@@ ously , on a collective level .
and yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tri@@ pl@@ ed in mass , going from the one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ quar@@ ter po@@ und brain of our ance@@ st@@ or here , hab@@ ili@@ s , to the almost three-@@ po@@ und me@@ at@@ lo@@ a@@ f that everybody here has between their e@@ ars .
but when i lec@@ ture to environ@@ ment@@ all@@ y-@@ concerned students , they tell me , &quot; no , everybody in the world cannot have cars and was@@ hing machines . &quot;
so this is the foot@@ age that i was showing everybody .
now this is obviously a powerful , some might say danger@@ ously powerful , insi@@ ght .
they &apos;re completely anony@@ mous , as it were .
and this , in terms of mag@@ nes@@ ium and the amount of water that i just mentioned , equ@@ ates to a $ 4@@ .@@ 5 billion min@@ ing industry for sing@@ apo@@ re -- a place that doesn &apos;t have any natural resources .
it provi@@ des a physical support structure for the trees , and it creates physical spaces , habit@@ able spaces inside of the sand dun@@ es .
ly@@ n : when i &apos;m making music , i feel like a pilot in the cock@@ p@@ it flying an airplane .
so , this s@@ ession &apos;s supposed to be about p@@ ure pleasure but glamour &apos;s really par@@ tly about meaning .
and &quot; ha@@ -@@ ha , there is a picture and here is i@@ . and what does it matter ? &quot;
so these three guys all understand how to produ@@ c@@ tively chan@@ nel dollars through our local econom@@ ies to meet exi@@ sting market dem@@ ands , reduce the social problems that we have now and prevent new problems in the future .
come right over here , next to me .
because it &apos;s not enough to re@@ move a leader or rul@@ er or dic@@ tat@@ or .
and what i &apos;d like to do is take you up to the can@@ op@@ y , not by putting all of you into rop@@ es and har@@ n@@ esses , but rather showing you a very short clip from a national geographic film called &quot; hero@@ es of the high fron@@ tier . &quot;
you will rec@@ all that in 197@@ 6 , jun@@ e 16 , the students of south africa bo@@ y@@ c@@ ot@@ ted the language of afri@@ ka@@ ans as the medium of the op@@ pres@@ sor , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in afri@@ ka@@ ans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
so we created a way to find out , and i got my first look at that famous be@@ ak in action .
in the good old days when this republi@@ can ran that company , their greatest work was work that built on the past , right .
there are problems of se@@ wa@@ ge over@@ flow and cont@@ am@@ ination , but i would also argue that almost every city has this ex@@ act condition , and it &apos;s a condition that we &apos;re all facing .
and my family brought in a woman whose mother had been a sla@@ ve to take care of me .
but no more than one percent of the people ac@@ knowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as in@@ san@@ e or something .
you may not appreci@@ ate the person , you may not appreci@@ ate anything else , but maybe you appreci@@ ate the fact that they &apos;ve got a tough gi@@ g .
we hope to have opened the door for more such research in this direction , so the rema@@ ining un@@ known ter@@ rain will be char@@ ted in the future .
and if i want to start having children by the time i &apos;m 35 , that meant that i would have had to have been on my way to marriage five years ago .
and it sta@@ ys that size until the queen dies and there &apos;s nobody to make more ants , when she &apos;s about 15 or 20 years old .
so , back to the public meeting .
and so i decided to write a book , a me@@ mo@@ ir , about this decade of my life .
and we should be developing things -- we should be developing pac@@ k@@ aging for ideas which el@@ ev@@ ate people &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tions and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth and trans@@ late into products for everyday use .
so that &apos;s what i &apos;m working on now .
you &apos;ll change your smar@@ t@@ phone seven or eight times , probably more if you &apos;re in this audience .
this here is nis@@ san &apos;s my@@ lea@@ f , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compe@@ te for who dri@@ ves around the most fuel effici@@ ently .
this qu@@ and@@ ary led to the ti@@ tle of the project , which consi@@ ders in many ways that we are all the living dead and that we in some ways represent g@@ ho@@ sts of the past and the future .
three years , and we can &apos;t do that now . crazy .
it &apos;s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players glob@@ ally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
but when you tell someone your goal and they ac@@ knowledge it , psych@@ ologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
you know i sat at home and i watched .
well , they &apos;ve now taken that gene , that bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ cent gene , and put it into mam@@ mal cells .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
now , clearly we &apos;re not going to put a couple of electro@@ des on his head and understand exactly what all of his thoughts are on the track .
well two years ago , we decided , let &apos;s transform the model of fighting hunger , and instead of giving out the food aid , we put it into food ban@@ ks .
but they were able to point to who and let them know that there was this surprising and un@@ expla@@ ined clu@@ ster of ill@@ n@@ esses that looked like bird flu .
they help us stay connected with people in our social network that we would otherwise grow dist@@ ant from , if we weren &apos;t playing games together .
these are cam@@ els moving across the ri@@ ft valley in africa , photograph@@ ed by chris john@@ s .
so , good things come out of , you know , in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion -- -- which i will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
and suddenly , out of the chaos , order .
and over time , this mush@@ room has evolved and adap@@ ted to se@@ ek out even the tin@@ i@@ est tra@@ ce of phosp@@ hor@@ us , and to put it to use , to make it available to the plant .
if i pull back from that global picture , and i look at the impli@@ cation over a similar period of time in terms of the technology -- which , as a tool , is a tool for designers , and i ci@@ te our own experience as a company , and i just illu@@ strate that by a small sele@@ ction of projects -- then how do you measure that change of technology ?
so let me explain how this works .
his father was an so@@ b , and , in fact , he was another com@@ edi@@ an with an un@@ happy childhood , but then we were off and running .
so , designers sometimes don &apos;t do things that are immediately func@@ tional , but they &apos;re func@@ tional to our understanding of issues .
first step , the medical doctor went away for about six months , and he worked on what were to become these nine health goals , what were we a@@ im@@ ing at .
and now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in japan .
and rapi@@ dly we started to realize that be@@ a@@ vers can be something that a bo@@ b@@ c@@ at needs .
obviously , here we have j@@ f@@ k with that incredibly simple and powerful for@@ mu@@ lation , &quot; ask not what your country can do for you ; ask what you can do for your country , &quot; an incredibly no@@ ble sen@@ ti@@ ment .
the leader of the ch@@ ie@@ fs said , &quot; no , sorry . we can &apos;t take you . you &apos;ll slow us down .
and to ha@@ ck@@ ers , dna is just another operating system waiting to be ha@@ cked .
now in the old days , conduc@@ ting , music making , was less about trust and more , frank@@ ly , about co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
so they do this both when they have power sort of chron@@ ically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
and the conclu@@ sion of that is that psychology and psychiat@@ ry , over the last 60 years , can actually cla@@ im that we can make mis@@ er@@ able people less mis@@ er@@ able .
the pas@@ sen@@ gers who fell off the ti@@ tan@@ ic fell into water of just five degrees centi@@ grade .
but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals .
when i click on y@@ ur@@ i g@@ ag@@ ar@@ in &apos;s page , i get this guy who was surpris@@ ingly short in stat@@ ure , huge in hero@@ ism .
i &apos;m going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this that we demon@@ strated in washington . can we look at this thing ?
and i knew mr. do@@ br@@ yn@@ in very well , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to sit bes@@ i@@ de mr@@ s. gor@@ ba@@ che@@ v ton@@ ight .
so today , i &apos;m going to tell you about some people who didn &apos;t move out of their neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
you have them in h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er societies , but then through technologi@@ cal evolution , new forms of technology ar@@ ise that facili@@ tate or encoura@@ ge the playing of non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum games , invol@@ ving more people over larger terri@@ tory .
we have liber@@ ia . we have con@@ go .
if you look out your window and you can see long &apos;s peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
and anyway , to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said , &quot; you know , perhaps i could connect all your bran@@ ches and make you more efficient . &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , like the human@@ e society .
ts : thank you , john .
li@@ ver cells , ner@@ ve cells , pan@@ crea@@ tic cells -- we still can &apos;t grow them even today .
these become for@@ th@@ right in places we need to protect .
in terms of where we are in science with dna identi@@ fication capac@@ i@@ ties and so on , it &apos;s not that far off .
so basically , the number of pages that mention this term , that also mention this page , the percentage of those pages is that person &apos;s google share of that term .
three com@@ post b@@ ins -- go through about 70 kil@@ os of ra@@ w vege@@ table waste a week -- really good , makes fantastic com@@ post .
so if this was happening , your memor@@ ies could start by place cells activ@@ ating each other via these den@@ se inter@@ connections and then re@@ activ@@ ating boundar@@ y cells to create the spa@@ tial structure of the scene around your vie@@ w@@ point .
colle@@ cting global health data was an im@@ perfect science : workers tra@@ mp@@ ed through villa@@ ges to kno@@ ck on do@@ ors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this ga@@ pp@@ y information , countries would make huge decisions . data ge@@ ek jo@@ el sel@@ ani@@ ki@@ o talks through the sea change in colle@@ cting health data in the past decade -- starting with the pal@@ m pilot and hot@@ mail , and now moving into the cloud . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspe@@ c@@ tives at the earli@@ est stage .
when you look at the new york times , you look at other eli@@ te media , what you lar@@ gely get are pictures of very weal@@ thy nations and the nations we &apos;ve inv@@ aded .
when food is sc@@ ar@@ ce , they diver@@ t nutri@@ ents towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and li@@ ver .
so as i spent time with leaders in the g@@ n@@ h movement , i got to really understand what they &apos;re doing .
the animal could be a co@@ w , lam@@ b , or even something more ex@@ o@@ tic .
treatment programs became possible , fund@@ ing became available , and the number of people on anti@@ retro@@ vi@@ ral drugs started to increase very rapi@@ dly .
&quot; what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn &apos;t even own a pair of shoes ? &quot;
all we have to do is to get our e@@ gos out of the way , get our e@@ go@@ tis@@ m out of the way .
it would be im@@ moral to leave these young people with a climate system spir@@ aling out of control .
then , a few years after@@ wards , using per@@ ma@@ cultural strategi@@ es , we green that part of the desert .
and you can go to the site right now . it &apos;s all free . not trying to sell anything .
i used to be a fan of b@@ ach . i used to play it on the gu@@ it@@ ar , you know .
you see , i grew up in war@@ -@@ tor@@ n iraq , and i believe that there are two sides of wars and we &apos;ve only seen one side of it .
solving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , rene@@ w@@ able energy .
but what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stam@@ p collect there .
the extre@@ mis@@ m on one side be@@ gets extre@@ mis@@ m on the other , a fact we should have learned many , many times over , and both extre@@ mes in this debate are just wrong .
so , that &apos;s 20 micro@@ meters across , that pollen grain there .
and so they decided , because they were intri@@ gu@@ ed by this finding , to do a nation@@ wide survey .
and the religious police im@@ pos@@ es the supposed islam@@ ic way of life on every citi@@ zen , by force -- like women are forced to cover their heads -- wear the hi@@ ja@@ b , the islam@@ ic head cover .
there are some of you in this room , amazing people , who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity .
if you saw these women on the street in their fa@@ ded clo@@ th@@ es , you might dis@@ miss them as poor and simple .
you could still buy the music , but you couldn &apos;t hear anything because it had been sil@@ enced .
we got ma@@ d@@ d ch@@ add , li@@ l &apos; c , kid david and j smo@@ oth .
so it acts as a screen to protect the ra@@ il and the com@@ mu@@ ter , and not to have objects fall@@ ing on the ra@@ ils .
it turns out that -- you see this sign on almost every commercial ves@@ sel in the united states -- you know , if you sp@@ ill@@ ed a couple of gall@@ ons of oil , you would be in big trouble .
so , we started with breast cancer because there &apos;s lots of money for it , no government money .
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strateg@@ ist , nor am i speci@@ alist . i am mer@@ ely a story@@ t@@ eller . &quot;
and it rais@@ es the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in the age of biot@@ echn@@ ology -- a question that we &apos;re not really sure yet how to solve .
i grew up her@@ ding , looking after our li@@ ve@@ stock -- go@@ ats , she@@ ep and c@@ attle .
another interesting project , though it &apos;s going to need some help , is the northern white r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os .
and that &apos;s what comes to the first step here .
now , go into the real atmosphere of this planet .
maybe have the same kind of security to play .
so , how warm or cold do you feel about , you know , na@@ tive americans , or the military , the republi@@ can party , the democratic party , all sorts of groups in american life .
now if i go on like this , you &apos;ll think that all the data comes from huge institutions and has nothing to do with you .
an increase of dop@@ am@@ ine caused subje@@ cts to see more patterns than those that did not recei@@ ve the dop@@ am@@ ine .
so anyway , today we &apos;ll talk about architecture a little bit , within the subject of creation and optimis@@ m .
how do you read a two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -year-old man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt that has been er@@ ased , cut up , written on and pain@@ ted over ? with a powerful partic@@ le acceler@@ ator , of course ! ancient books cur@@ ator willi@@ am no@@ el tells the fascinating story behind the archi@@ me@@ des pal@@ imp@@ s@@ est , a by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine pra@@ yer book contain@@ ing previ@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ un@@ known original wri@@ t@@ ings from ancient gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian archi@@ me@@ des and others .
he used the example of a common gra@@ zing area in which each person by simply ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing their own flo@@ ck led to over@@ gra@@ zing and the de@@ ple@@ tion of the resource .
on the wall is my book called &quot; super@@ natural , &quot; which allows me to remember what i &apos;ve done , because i forget .
and then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the com@@ mu@@ te .
and these are the two concep@@ ts i &apos;d like to explore .
and if you read the press , it actually last week said i qu@@ it the media lab .
spending per student only explains about , well , less than 20 percent of the performance vari@@ ation among countries , and lux@@ em@@ b@@ our@@ g , for example , the most expensive system , doesn &apos;t do particularly well .
secon@@ dly , making them inter@@ active .
for example , you can &apos;t post the name of the president , h@@ u j@@ in@@ ta@@ o , and also you can &apos;t post the city of ch@@ on@@ g@@ q@@ ing , the name , and until recently , you can &apos;t search the sur@@ name of top leaders .
then the next day , i held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
if you dri@@ ll water to make co@@ ke near a village farm , that &apos;s not illegal , but yes , it costs the community .
the creative spirit in africa , the creative tradition , is as po@@ tent as it has always been , if only designers could look within .
i had just taken tri@@ gon@@ ome@@ try in high school , i learned about the par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a and how it could concent@@ rate ra@@ ys of light to a single focus .
some of the teen@@ a@@ gers said that in fact the car was 15 feet away when it shot .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into kn@@ ots , trying to figure out whether or not blog@@ gers are journ@@ alists .
it felt like we were kind of la@@ ying these under@@ ground c@@ ables that wouldn &apos;t light up their world for many years to come .
and then this is what we called the &quot; dead head , &quot; no re@@ ference to jer@@ ry gar@@ ci@@ a .
by the end of this year , you &apos;ll be able to drive from l@@ .@@ a. to new york just using the super@@ char@@ ger network , which char@@ ges at five times the rate of anything else .
but for every disaster we had , the mar@@ ath@@ on found ways to bring people together .
so again , we can see that price plays an enormous role in people &apos;s will@@ ing@@ ness to reduce their driving behavior .
we now know that at g@@ om@@ be alone , there are nine different ways in which chimpanze@@ es use different objects for different pur@@ pos@@ es .
if we really want to come to a point , we really want to put a ca@@ p on our carbon emis@@ sion , we want to really lower the use of energy -- it has to be solved in countries like india .
the only ex@@ ception is the na@@ ked som@@ ali@@ an mole@@ -@@ rat , which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground .
the other week , i went on one of these sites , appropri@@ ately called swa@@ p@@ tree , and there were over 5@@ 9@@ ,@@ 300 it@@ em@@ s that i could inst@@ antly swa@@ p for my copy of &quot; 24 . &quot;
and all of those black dots are all of the tox@@ ic rele@@ ase inv@@ ent@@ ories that are monit@@ or@@ ed by the ep@@ a .
but there were times when i wanted to re@@ mind both sides that this was fi@@ ction .
and if we re@@ move the myster@@ y of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
right now , it feels like i for@@ got to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now sha@@ des of gra@@ y and it seems like the world is sp@@ inning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am sp@@ inning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the now everybody s@@ ings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just brea@@ the thank you .
my student pr@@ an@@ a@@ v , who &apos;s really , like i said , the geni@@ us behind this .
so here is the earth . it &apos;s a little less than a milli@@ meter that was turned of soli@@ d bron@@ ze .
despite the pictures we are shown daily in the news , wars between developed countries are no longer common@@ place .
so , let me show you what happens .
it &apos;s very fashi@@ on@@ able to talk about human traff@@ i@@ cking , in this fantastic a-@@ c hall .
charles darwin and i and you broke off from the family tree from chimpanze@@ es about five million years ago .
there can be different ways doing this .
so this is the internet they have in mind .
well done , ladies and gentle@@ men .
again , same choice ; they can play it safe for always getting two gra@@ pes every single time , or they can take a ris@@ ky bet and choose between one and three .
now , there &apos;s more good news that came along later in evolution , a second kind of evolutionary lo@@ gic .
and if you can , just scri@@ b@@ ble a pattern .
he &apos;s like , &quot; no , miss , i &apos;m not going .
and i was like , &quot; all we need is al@@ as@@ ka not to get the last mem@@ o , and here we go all over again . &quot;
it &apos;s a disease that runs in my family , and we really hope that cells like these will help us find a cure .
they meet ne@@ anderth@@ als , mix with them , continue to spread over the world , and somewhere in sou@@ the@@ ast asia , they meet den@@ iso@@ v@@ ans and mix with them and continue on out into the pacific .
but if you &apos;re losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your col@@ on@@ ies , you can &apos;t survive three years in a row . and we &apos;re really worried about losing this se@@ gment of our industry .
so this is the sig@@ nature out of which we &apos;re trying to get patterns .
it costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a dis@@ k and put it online , if you &apos;re doing things in volu@@ me .
yes , it &apos;s going to continue .
it will re@@ fer you directly to your con@@ gr@@ es@@ sper@@ son , to your u.s. sen@@ ator , to your gover@@ nor where di@@ v@@ est@@ ment leg@@ is@@ lation is pen@@ ding .
and the religi@@ ons that should be making a major contribu@@ tion are instead seen as part of the problem .
and fr@@ as@@ er &apos;s on his k@@ ne@@ es , arms ti@@ ed behind his back , and he &apos;s cr@@ ying .
instead of invest@@ ing in a car , we invest in a community .
leaders hold a position of power or auth@@ ority , but those who lead inspi@@ re us .
now comes the green movement -- the summer of 2009 , as my film is rele@@ ased -- the u@@ pris@@ ing begins in the streets of te@@ hr@@ an .
there &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way i ur@@ ge you to join me .
and something else happened , these people who went through the process and tou@@ ched the sna@@ ke ended up having less an@@ x@@ iety about other things in their lives .
the di@@ ver here has a rop@@ e to@@ y , and i &apos;m on the key@@ board on the left , and i &apos;ve just played the rop@@ e key , and that &apos;s the requ@@ est for the to@@ y from the human .
the next conc@@ ern was whether i would walk again , because i was paraly@@ zed from the wa@@ ist down .
thank you . all right .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the d@@ wind@@ ling of capacity with increasing fra@@ il@@ ty , and fra@@ il@@ ty &apos;s an inevi@@ table part of aging , and increasing fra@@ il@@ ty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of dis@@ ability , unfortunately .
but the question that l@@ ing@@ ered in my mind was , what causes people to destro@@ y fire tru@@ cks head@@ ed to their own homes ?
but the reality is , these crazy cases are relatively rare . they don &apos;t usually win .
the short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from japan .
your last job , your dinner reser@@ va@@ tions from last year , your former friends , lie on a flat pla@@ in with today &apos;s friends , because the internet also archi@@ ves , and it war@@ ps the past .
and so , going back to this ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , bes@@ i@@ des being nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female ab@@ alone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; this is how to build an ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te material .
and , of course , we &apos;re not responsible for the consequences of what we &apos;re doing now , are we ? like all this com@@ pla@@ int about c@@ lon@@ es .
and he said , &quot; you are the bridge . &quot;
and i truly believe until the issue of memor@@ ial is sor@@ ted out , that it &apos;s going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion .
it &apos;s the economy of moving these heavy , slow atoms over long di@@ stances that &apos;s very difficult to do .
but curi@@ ously , red@@ wood rain@@ fore@@ sts , the frag@@ ments that we have left , to this day re@@ main under@@ -@@ explor@@ ed .
th@@ ank@@ fully , i was able to answer a , and i say that hon@@ est@@ ly in case my life in@@ sur@@ ance ag@@ ent is listening .
if you &apos;re a games company , and you &apos;ve got a million players in your game , you only need one percent of them to be co-@@ develop@@ ers , contribu@@ ting ideas , and you &apos;ve got a development work@@ force of 10,000 people .
a cou@@ sin of mine died of aids , left an or@@ ph@@ an , so we said , well , what are we going to do with her ?
you can t@@ we@@ et your weight to your friends , and they can keep you in line .
they said they were going to beat us up if we didn &apos;t make some g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der for them .
i mean , today , sing@@ apo@@ re is a first world country and ghana is not .
what if they look up at the night sky , at the same stars , but from the opposite side ?
when it has a sc@@ ar@@ ce resource that it wants to turn into a des@@ ir@@ able out@@ come , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
no sl@@ ou@@ ching , no pants han@@ ging down , none of that stuff .
traditional lab tests for disease diagno@@ sis can be too expensive and cum@@ ber@@ some for the regi@@ ons most in need . george whit@@ es@@ i@@ des &apos; in@@ geni@@ ous answer is a fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of tool that can be manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red at virtu@@ ally zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s exactly what people used to say to sue .
but i think a much bigger problem with this is that this lo@@ gic -- that we should be dro@@ pping ipo@@ ds not bom@@ bs -- i mean , it would make a fascinating ti@@ tle for thomas frie@@ d@@ man &apos;s new book .
and , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can tra@@ ce food coming in to it .
jo@@ ining me are three of our eight atlan@@ tic bot@@ t@@ len@@ o@@ se dolph@@ ins : 20@@ -year-old ch@@ es@@ a@@ pe@@ a@@ ke , who was our first dolph@@ in born here , her four@@ -year-old daughter ba@@ y@@ ley , and her half sister , 1@@ 1@@ -year-old may@@ a .
and it &apos;s based on a few thousand people we &apos;ve sam@@ pl@@ ed from , you know , a hand@@ ful of popu@@ lations around the world .
i started a couple of businesses that i thought would be the ti@@ cket to financial freedom .
now i know you don &apos;t think that .
it cost 1.@@ 7 million dollars to develop . it &apos;s called &quot; go &quot; by ber@@ n@@ hard@@ t , usa .
and th@@ us , as people started feeling ow@@ ner@@ ship over wild@@ life , wild@@ life numbers started coming back , and that &apos;s actually becoming a foundation for conser@@ vation in nam@@ i@@ bia .
it &apos;s just a colle@@ ction of things that have been done before , but bringing them together in a different way .
we need data , we don &apos;t need help .
but as soon as they passed by , it would start to clim@@ b up the wall in jer@@ ky fashion .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a preg@@ nan@@ cy test .
we can run the sc@@ ore up against anybody , and then get our as@@ ses ki@@ cked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation war@@ f@@ are .
but you notice , i &apos;ve che@@ ated , because i &apos;ve only gone up to &apos; 9@@ 4 .
and i would say the non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic is only going to grow more inten@@ se over time because of technologi@@ cal trends , but more inten@@ se in a kind of negative way .
of the 100 in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated people that are rele@@ ased , 60 will return to prison .
but i put that slide in there because i &apos;m often asked if there are any animals in the project .
i thought , it &apos;ll have to do .
as you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
and i said -- i got worried , i said , my god , i mean i &apos;ve changed this guy &apos;s body image , what about human subje@@ cts , eth@@ ics and all of that ?
and so if you hear an exper@@ t talking about the internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skep@@ tic@@ ism that you might treat the comm@@ ents of an econom@@ ist about the economy or a wea@@ ther@@ man about the weather , or something like that .
well , thank you . i mean , it &apos;s interesting , in doing this , we had to sit together with the companies .
and most people say , &quot; ok , i &apos;ll play . &quot;
and suppose they have , you know , very different sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us , and so on .
and i was on the c@@ us@@ p of , sort of , ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence , so i was starting to take bis@@ cu@@ its from the tin without asking .
now , diabetes is one of the big ones .
in fact , it &apos;s continu@@ ed to increase .
so what we &apos;re seeing is moving this burning or publi@@ cation process from the regular sort of sing@@ le-@@ auth@@ or@@ ed book towards commun@@ it@@ y-@@ auth@@ or@@ ed materials that are mod@@ ular , that are custom@@ i@@ zed to each individual class and published on demand very in@@ expen@@ si@@ vely , either pus@@ hed out through ama@@ zon , or published directly through an on-@@ demand press , like co@@ op .
and the speed with which they associ@@ ate it with &quot; sl@@ um@@ dog milli@@ on@@ ai@@ re &quot; or the fa@@ vel@@ as in rio spea@@ ks to the en@@ during nature .
i hope you will respect my soldiers , this soldi@@ er with this gun .
and i didn &apos;t know what to do .
and ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya says , &quot; i was with you . who do you think was making need@@ les and making ne@@ sts and dri@@ pping on ro@@ cks for you , mi@@ ster den@@ se ? &quot;
now as anthropo@@ logi@@ sts , we know that every culture has an orig@@ in story .
moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentle@@ man called h@@ ans jen@@ ny in the 197@@ 0s .
from three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has vir@@ ally swe@@ pt around the world .
now maybe that &apos;s been obvious to all of you for a long time , but for me , as often as i &apos;d en@@ counter@@ ed that ex@@ act diffic@@ ul@@ ty on a daily basis , i had never seen the in@@ her@@ ent challenge of communication in so cr@@ y@@ st@@ all@@ ine a light .
and then , i will demon@@ strate a thing from russi@@ an satelli@@ te , ste@@ alen -- stol@@ en , probably cop@@ i@@ ed from america but we will see .
and then she made me go up with the ta@@ pe of it and prove that george ab@@ bot@@ t actually could talk .
while this is something that comes from our mind , it also has its roots deeply into the co@@ smo@@ s .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , gui@@ ded by a small number of simple principles .
and finally , an e@@ bay li@@ sting for one well-@@ travel@@ ed slide show , now ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , museum piece . please contact al gore .
and we can then see the result of such mu@@ tations when we compare dna sequences among us here in the room , for example .
for me , like millions of other people around the world today , english is an ac@@ qui@@ red language .
and they come and give the mol@@ as -- you can see they stri@@ ke this funny little position that says , &quot; i &apos;m not thre@@ at@@ ening , but i need a mas@@ sage . &quot;
you know , we have to go through that .
so , we came up with multiple hypo@@ thes@@ es : there &apos;s little green people down there taking it ; there &apos;s all sorts of things going on .
so if we take some out@@ bo@@ und path -- perhaps we park and we wan@@ der off -- we know because our own mov@@ ements , which we can integra@@ te over this path roughly what the head@@ ing direction is to go back .
in dat@@ ing , the transition from friend@@ ship to sex can lead to , not@@ ori@@ ously , various forms of aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness , and as can sex in the work@@ place , in which we call the conflict between a domin@@ ant and a sexual relationship &quot; sexual har@@ as@@ s@@ ment . &quot;
u.n. opened their stati@@ stic dat@@ ab@@ ases , and we have a new version of the software up working as a bet@@ a on the net , so you don &apos;t have to down@@ load it any longer .
i accept where we are .
so , we deser@@ ve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else .
so i went to russi@@ a , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; so@@ vi@@ et union .
the human form , in particular the human head , has been considered the hol@@ y gra@@ il of our industry .
we can continue the search for the ingre@@ di@@ ents we love , and we can continue to sp@@ in y@@ ar@@ ns about our favorite me@@ als .
we have to have a uni@@ fied view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting weal@@ thy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
if we &apos;ve got them wired up with an electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m , the right brain of each of them becomes att@@ un@@ ed , so that the jo@@ y@@ ful emergen@@ ce of this earli@@ est of play scen@@ es and the physi@@ ology of that is something we &apos;re beginning to get a hand@@ le on .
this is a case where the software now buil@@ ds its own hard@@ ware , and that &apos;s the no@@ tions that we have with biology .
we &apos;ve cho@@ sen to re@@ define the health care system as a doctor , a nur@@ se and a ment@@ or mother .
it isn &apos;t when the sh@@ in@@ y new tools show up that their uses start per@@ me@@ ating society .
however , not one of you got out of your se@@ ats to think , &quot; right ! how can i cla@@ p ? ok , maybe ...
ro@@ ger . i got &apos; em .
in other words , i look for ali@@ ens , and when i tell people that at a cock@@ tail party , they usually look at me with a mil@@ dly incre@@ dul@@ ous look on their face .
but the group of da@@ y@@ care centers repres@@ ented by the black line , they said , &quot; we are changing this bar@@ gain as of right now .
the h@@ are itself , the animal -- not a c@@ at , not a dog , a h@@ are -- why a h@@ are ?
so let &apos;s start she@@ d@@ ding light on this amazing ec@@ lec@@ tic continent that has so much to offer .
and many of these chemicals are now lin@@ ked to the sky@@ rock@@ eting inci@@ dents of chr@@ onic childhood disease that we &apos;re seeing across industri@@ alized nations .
this is what we would love students to re@@ tain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
again , &quot; in@@ ward out . &quot;
i grew up in the middle of no@@ where on a di@@ rt road in rural ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as , an hour from the ne@@ ar@@ est movie theater .
&quot; why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; what should we do about it while we are ?
a@@ o : you did teach yourself to play , and as a con@@ sequence , playing the piano for you , derek , was a lot of k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les and kar@@ ate ch@@ ops , and even a bit of nose going on in there .
normal . let &apos;s get on schools , something that i &apos;m fairly much a speci@@ alist in .
and in grad school i became interested in creatures that d@@ well in the hidden cor@@ ners of the city .
but what we lose , i think , is an accu@@ rate -- a felt sense of the sky , a sense of context .
and here , this is a fl@@ y-@@ through the cloud of points of ti@@ k@@ al , and here you see it ren@@ dered and phot@@ o-@@ tex@@ tured with the photograph@@ y that we take of the site .
microsoft &apos;s ste@@ phen law@@ ler gives a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper@@ -@@ real c@@ it@@ y@@ scap@@ es with da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty , a remarkable fe@@ at that requires st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing amo@@ unts of data to bring into focus .
as i come out of the water , sol@@ ly arri@@ ves at a deep section , a chan@@ nel between us .
and then to generate the display you &apos;re about to see , all i did was touch it once per second on its ner@@ ve ring with a shar@@ p pick that &apos;s sort of like the shar@@ p to@@ oth of a fish .
because this is -- i &apos;m quite an experienced man@@ ager of systems as a pilot , but this is really -- you need flu@@ i@@ di@@ ty , you need to be agi@@ le and also to ada@@ pt really fast .
there they met children who are with a different standard and a different min@@ d@@ set , a totally different society .
this worked well for most pa@@ tho@@ gens , some@@ what well for cra@@ f@@ ty bu@@ gs like flu , but not at all for hiv , for which humans have no natural imm@@ unity .
they thought this was fundamental .
i &apos;m used to algorith@@ ms and data structures and super motiv@@ ated students , and nothing in my background prepared me to deal with a ra@@ ging , violent ad@@ oles@@ cent in the middle of no@@ where .
but in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain what the web was like .
and the reason the effici@@ en@@ cies are so low is these re@@ ac@@ tors operate at pretty low temperature .
books have saved the intro@@ ver@@ ted , ti@@ mi@@ d child that i was -- that i once was .
let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with syn@@ thetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
i mean , the psych@@ ologist er@@ ik eri@@ k@@ son says that -- as i understand him and i &apos;m a total ama@@ te@@ ur -- but that during 3@@ 0s , 4@@ 0s people are driven by this desire to grow and that &apos;s where they get their ful@@ fil@@ l@@ ment .
some are driven by compassion , feel it &apos;s perhaps one of the fundamental acts of humanity .
the ab@@ alone sh@@ ell here -- and if you fra@@ c@@ ture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nan@@ o-@@ struc@@ tured .
if you know something more , you probably know that uganda , to date , is the only country in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa that has had success in com@@ b@@ ating the epidemic .
if you believe that i am my connec@@ tom@@ e , i think you must also accept the idea that death is the destruction of your connec@@ tom@@ e .
also , those very sounds tend not to be repres@@ ented by the characters that are available in european languages .
opened a theme park through a licen@@ se in ku@@ wait a year and a half ago called the 99 village theme park -- 3@@ 0@@ 0,000 square feet , 20 ri@@ des , all with our characters : a couple back@@ -@@ to-@@ school licen@@ ses in spa@@ in and tur@@ key .
as i say in my book , i &apos;m je@@ wish in the same way the o@@ live garden is itali@@ an .
it has these strong , hero@@ ic arms that can li@@ ft dou@@ gh@@ nu@@ ts into your mouth .
we will find that these children , too , have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty .
or you can go back and change the hei@@ ght . now , sk@@ ill .
they could be creative in terms of education , they may be creative in terms of culture , they may be creative in terms of institutions ; but a lot of our work is in the field of technologi@@ cal creativity , the innova@@ tions , either in terms of con@@ temporary innova@@ tions , or in terms of traditional knowledge .
well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . we had to basically step inside a body .
women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pul@@ l-@@ u@@ ps .
it wouldn &apos;t eat . it wouldn &apos;t sleep . it wouldn &apos;t have sex .
everything except rand@@ om@@ ness . she did not believe in rand@@ om@@ ness .
when i look around this tedx@@ am@@ ster@@ dam venue , i see a very special audience .
and if you &apos;re happy with that , fantastic .
she was very much like those women sitting behind the se@@ wing machines .
now here , we see the role for an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented co@@ ali@@ tion of social media gi@@ ants and up@@ starts , tele@@ com@@ s companies , reality tv show forma@@ ts , gam@@ ing companies , tele@@ com@@ s , all of them together in kind of their &quot; we are the world &quot; moment .
and we &apos;re not going to cure the problems of the urban by dra@@ g@@ ging the country into the city , which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time .
you see the sk@@ at@@ ers often trick in this direction . the ob@@ stac@@ les are easier .
and i met juli@@ us the last week that i was living in ki@@ ber@@ a .
i said we can sh@@ orten the colum@@ n , we can spread it out to cover the cou@@ ch .
and then , the 9@@ 2 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles .
and the thing is , is that this isn &apos;t google .
an individual , for the first time in the history of humanity , will have the capacity , by 20@@ 30 , to destro@@ y the planet , to w@@ re@@ ck everything , through the creation , for example , of a bi@@ op@@ a@@ tho@@ gen .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec@@ ell@@ ul@@ ari@@ zed organs .
when computers were first introduced , they were said to be a million times faster than neurons .
and i think that &apos;s how we got to become human .
and together these volunte@@ ers and the teachers are deeply commit@@ ted to creating a new generation of global , green leaders .
i just wanted to say that i miss you , and i love you , and please come back to me and stay alive .
and if you do that , the origami &apos;s the same size , but the resul@@ ting square that you get is three times bigger .
so what happened now is , when the water@@ color was flo@@ wing into the structure , the water@@ colors do not mix with the fer@@ ro@@ flu@@ id .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;ve always been interested in , is that -- which is a personal kind of expression .
and i followed this guy everywhere until i had him in the room , and i read him one of my pieces , and you know what he told me ?
this is stan@@ ley mil@@ gra@@ m , little je@@ wish kid from the bronx , and he asked the question , &quot; could the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st happen here , now ? &quot;
what jack ni@@ chol@@ son might be up to in his cele@@ bri@@ ty life , and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road ra@@ ge and gol@@ f-@@ clu@@ b@@ bed a driver the other day .
so we have port@@ al because you sho@@ ot walls in order to create new spaces .
we have da@@ wn or@@ bit@@ ing v@@ est@@ a , and we have over here new hori@@ z@@ ons on a straight shot to plu@@ to .
ho@@ spi@@ ce was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &apos;t dying .
and the great ir@@ ony and trage@@ dy of our time is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still argu@@ ing about that .
and what , if anything , do men have to do with it ?
the rule is about a 10@@ -@@ year del@@ ay for a new product to go to market in developing countries , if at all .
and i &apos;m going to leave you with one last demon@@ stration , but before i do that , i would like to say thank you , and think small .
b@@ l : i &apos;m going to fa@@ st-@@ forward to the decision point because i know i don &apos;t have a lot of time .
so , she &apos;ll make a little pair of d@@ ung@@ are@@ es with cor@@ du@@ ro@@ ys , with african material mix@@ ed in . very creative designs , has reach@@ ed a stage where she even had an order from wal@@ -@@ m@@ art .
we are already l@@ ac@@ ed up as if we &apos;re in a fi@@ ber op@@ tic cor@@ set , if you like .
i mean , the great diffic@@ ul@@ ty in europe is if you &apos;re at a meeting and 27 people speak , it takes a very very long time .
i was raised with traditional stories of leadership : robert e@@ . lee , john bu@@ ford at ge@@ tt@@ y@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
that &apos;s the region where entrop@@ y is low .
i get to do this all the time , and it &apos;s just incredible .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this pres@@ entation has been brought to you by target .
and then what happens is , there &apos;s a b@@ low to your head , dama@@ ging the cortex , allo@@ wing these lat@@ ent sexual ur@@ ges to emer@@ ge , fl@@ aming to the surface , and suddenly and in@@ ex@@ pli@@ c@@ ably you find yourself being sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed by your mother .
and he turned around . and then he divi@@ ded into six fig@@ ures in stri@@ ped shir@@ ts , who started walking towards her .
if you don &apos;t want to be dec@@ ei@@ ved , you have to know , what is it that you &apos;re hun@@ gry for ?
and mean@@ while , i was tour@@ ing lo@@ cally and playing in ni@@ ght@@ clu@@ bs with my band , the d@@ res@@ den doll@@ s .
i &apos;ll show you what they look like .
i have a solution that requires nei@@ ther machine , nor wood , nor cooking gas .
and then the next plan@@ ting seas@@ on , when they san@@ g the dir@@ ge , they would re@@ move as many names of the dead that equ@@ aled as many people that were born .
d@@ l : so anyway , we &apos;re running out of time , so i &apos;ll just get to it .
yes , contr@@ ast .
and i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and he said , &quot; why can &apos;t i ? &quot;
for the first time , actually , in a long time i wanted to meet those individuals , i wanted to meet these entreprene@@ urs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
so that &apos;s what i want to walk you through .
these mountains are dangerous places , but ultimately the fa@@ te of these bear families , and indeed that of all be@@ ars around the north pacific , depen@@ ds on the sal@@ mon .
the first time , nothing will happen , because the system has no idea how he thinks about &quot; pull . &quot;
i mean , literally , her home@@ town is called whit@@ es@@ ville , west virg@@ ini@@ a .
and there are two important mes@@ sages , or two lessons , to take from that reality .
because we &apos;ve solved the problem in ch@@ u@@ but pro@@ vin@@ ce , which is like a state in ar@@ gent@@ ina where pun@@ ta tom@@ bo is -- so that &apos;s about 1,000 kilometers of co@@ ast@@ line -- but we haven &apos;t solved the problem in northern ar@@ gent@@ ina , ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay and brazil .
they typ@@ ed it into google , transl@@ ated it into itali@@ an , went back into itali@@ an google .
all open , all available .
and many of you may have noticed that doesn &apos;t have as big an effect , as perhaps you would like it to have .
and you can see this looks a bit like a che@@ f &apos;s hat , but actually that &apos;s an as@@ sau@@ lt , the one in blue .
if you &apos;re interested in more information , we have a website that descri@@ bes this exciting and intri@@ gu@@ ing mission , and why we want to do it .
and as you can see , there are not only two princi@@ p@@ al technical discipl@@ ines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various speci@@ alists from within those two discipl@@ ines .
i don &apos;t mean that we evolved to join gigan@@ tic organized religi@@ ons .
and another key thing that i learned a lot throughout this whole process , last year google named me as one of the bri@@ gh@@ test young minds in the world .
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham bu@@ tt problem .
that &apos;s what we all need to do .
the united states had developed a couple of atom@@ ic weapons through the manhattan project , and the idea was very stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward : we would use the power of the at@@ om to end the at@@ ro@@ cities and the hor@@ ror of this un@@ en@@ ding world war ii that we &apos;d been involved in in europe and in the pacific .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
once upon a time , the world was a big , dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional family .
but they also talk about the fact that their ex@@ ecu@@ tives , all of their expen@@ se repor@@ ts are put onto their company in@@ tran@@ et for everyone to see .
you didn &apos;t break it . it &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
i mean , just incredible to see bun@@ ches of gh@@ ari@@ al bas@@ king on the river again .
so we tried , and i &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
but there are also countries here like gu@@ atem@@ ala , like pa@@ pu@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a , like ye@@ men and afghanistan .
and here you can see how they really cra@@ f@@ ted a beautiful design process with physical models , with quanti@@ ta@@ tive , as well as qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative , metho@@ ds to come to a final solution that is truly integr@@ ated and completely ho@@ li@@ stic with the architecture .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
the head is held in line with the sp@@ ine , so that you use strate@@ gic water pressure to raise your legs up -- very important , especially for people with lower body fat .
but that sub@@ divi@@ des chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , islam and budd@@ h@@ ism into many sub@@ groups , which was too deta@@ iled .
instead , again , it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater , but we can only see am@@ i@@ d@@ st the fo@@ g the people immediately around us .
there are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the gl@@ ories of human existence .
and one of them said , &quot; come here . i think i can help you out here . &quot;
el nin@@ o comes and goes . it &apos;s not a disaster , it &apos;s rhyth@@ mic .
and they can be mod@@ el@@ ed by a spr@@ ing-@@ mass system that we call the spring mass system because we &apos;re bi@@ ome@@ chan@@ ists . it &apos;s actually a po@@ go stick .
so if it &apos;s a cell or a ter@@ mi@@ te or a bird , you just focus on the rules of interaction .
they &apos;re basically attemp@@ ts at fig@@ uring out what people should do instead of rus@@ h hour car driving .
most mom@@ s coo@@ ked like mine : a piece of bro@@ iled meat , a quickly made sal@@ ad with bot@@ t@@ led d@@ res@@ sing , can@@ ned sou@@ p , can@@ ned fru@@ it sal@@ ad .
the my@@ ce@@ li@@ um , in the right conditions , produ@@ ces a mush@@ room -- it bur@@ sts through with such fer@@ o@@ city that it can break as@@ p@@ halt .
and this ble@@ w his mind . literally . he che@@ cked into a san@@ it@@ ari@@ um .
and to re@@ mind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
this pe@@ ers , in@@ c. concept is in a very difficult and complex real@@ m .
and , in 197@@ 2 , this nation began to establi@@ sh a counter@@ part in the sea , national marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ aries .
and after just three minutes in that water , he was able to get himself out .
not only does she have to keep our isra@@ el@@ i and pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an contribu@@ tors from killing each other , she has to figure out what is going to interest you about the middle east .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ented this .
so if you look at the little scri@@ pt here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
in fact , just studying the r@@ ings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the dis@@ cs of stars and gas that we call the spi@@ ral galaxies .
if you sub@@ stit@@ ute the word blo@@ go@@ sphere , of the internet today , it is very true that his understanding is probably very en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ing now . let &apos;s listen in to him .
we see companies like the brazi@@ li@@ an fore@@ stry company fi@@ bri@@ a that &apos;s figured out how to avoid te@@ aring down old growth forest and using eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus and getting much more y@@ i@@ el@@ d per he@@ ct@@ are of pul@@ p and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees .
this is learning something , learning an idea , from an organis@@ m and then appl@@ ying it .
it &apos;s a story of public education and of rural communities and of what design might do to improve both .
seriously , with the amount of change i had noticed in this square , i thought it was 12 years .
well i built a fusion re@@ actor when i was 14 years old .
sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless . sh@@ am@@ eless .
it is very easy to fall in love with the de@@ cent@@ r@@ alized , bot@@ tom@@ -up structure of the internet .
they were trying to answer the question of what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive ?
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you of this , of the impact on hospital clin@@ ic resources is profound and then the impact on diseases is equ@@ ally impres@@ sive across all these different diseases and more .
and i found these maps which you see here .
and again , when you can take kids from back@@ gro@@ unds as diver@@ se as this to do something as special as this , we &apos;re really creating a moment .
the in@@ do@@ -@@ european ro@@ ot of the word hope is a stem , k-@@ e-@@ u -- we would sp@@ ell it k-@@ e-@@ u ; it &apos;s pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ced ko@@ y -- and it is the same ro@@ ot from which the word cur@@ ve comes from .
now we free@@ ze the action , 30 minutes , we turn time into the ver@@ tical axis , and we open up for a view of these interaction tra@@ ces we &apos;ve just left behind .
there are many , many sites where war@@ heads are stor@@ ed and , in fact , lots of sites where fis@@ sion@@ able materials , like highly en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um and plu@@ ton@@ ium , are absolutely not safe .
the problem , as we see it , has to do with a single , simple word : &quot; space , &quot; or a single , simple phr@@ ase : &quot; real world geome@@ try . &quot;
but i decided to learn about the bi@@ ble and my her@@ it@@ age by actually di@@ ving in and trying to live it and immer@@ se myself in it .
and yes , the red planet is red .
i was asked to design the building , because the theme of the exp@@ o was environmental issues .
and the next map now shows africa &apos;s g@@ dp in 1960 , around the time of indepen@@ dence for many african states .
mr. tes@@ z@@ ler hi@@ red 16 men : eight white , eight black .
so there &apos;s tons of ways that we can connect to other people , and it seems to be universal .
so if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work , we need look only no far@@ ther than africa to find these rob@@ ust self-@@ organi@@ zing algorith@@ ms .
and this material that &apos;s de@@ pos@@ ited either starts as a liquid form or a material po@@ w@@ der form .
so , the ants in the older col@@ ony that seem to be more stable are not any older than the ants in the yo@@ unger col@@ ony .
but i was driven by an in@@ her@@ ent sense that a picture that reve@@ aled the true face of war would almost by definition be an anti-@@ war photograph .
now i don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a fit 10@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a-@@ day office rat isn &apos;t more bal@@ an@@ ced ; it &apos;s more fit .
let me just say , look , my job is a privi@@ lege because we &apos;re in a special time .
engineer : absolutely . intervie@@ wer : you thought , &quot; oh , bo@@ ther . &quot;
that sort of over@@ all sustainable energy problem is the biggest problem that we have to solve this century , independent of environmental concern@@ s .
their pictures became part of our collective consciousness and , as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of con@@ science , change became not only possible , but inevi@@ table .
there was so many skep@@ tics , especially the press in london , that they started flying che@@ es@@ e@@ bur@@ gers on heli@@ cop@@ ters around my box to temp@@ t me .
there &apos;s no real word for stuff that makes us sec@@ ure , but doesn &apos;t make us feel sec@@ ure .
and so , 25 years ago , there was a peak oil ; just like , in the 19@@ 20@@ s , there was a peak coal ; and a hundred years before that , there was a peak wood .
you have to have those steps . if you have -- it &apos;s easy to get kids interested in science .
i &apos;m not saying it &apos;s easy .
and because we don &apos;t know our pre@@ fer@@ ences that well we &apos;re sus@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble to all of these influ@@ ences from the ex@@ ternal forces : the de@@ fau@@ l@@ ts , the particular op@@ tions that are pres@@ ented to us , and so on .
we agre@@ ed we &apos;d speak up in our own communities when we wit@@ n@@ essed the kind of &quot; other@@ i@@ zing &quot; talk that can wo@@ und and fe@@ ster into par@@ an@@ o@@ ia and then be used by those on the fr@@ ing@@ es to inci@@ te .
we can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get hea@@ vier , and then we can take anything out .
and we will begin to actually deeply influence our health and our intelligence , as we get closer and closer to this technology .
and i started doing research , and we found , very exc@@ it@@ ingly , that the skin produ@@ ces ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xide .
at that age , obviously , i couldn &apos;t express it that way , but i told her i didn &apos;t feel right .
now , to do that , we needed a set up , like a ma@@ gi@@ cian &apos;s trick .
it &apos;s the idea of an ever@@ -@@ ever@@ -@@ land , emerging from an ancient civilization , united by a shared history , but susta@@ ined , above all , by pl@@ ur@@ alist democracy .
in 199@@ 8 , lar@@ son and with@@ am po@@ ll@@ ed the cre@@ am of american scientists , those who &apos;d been hon@@ or@@ ed by ele@@ ction to the national acade@@ my of sci@@ ences , and among this sele@@ ct group , belief in a personal god dro@@ pped to a sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ing seven percent .
so the don@@ ors have to stick with this situation for at least a decade .
i &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in po@@ land .
now how do we know about an environment that &apos;s so far away , and so different , and so alien , from anything we &apos;re used to ?
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recogni@@ tion software , and you have to be kind of quie@@ t because the software is nervous .
fact is , there &apos;s a general rule : if you don &apos;t like it , it &apos;s fa@@ ke ; if you do like it , it &apos;s fau@@ x .
it &apos;s not different , it &apos;s the same stuff : cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate , cal@@ ci@@ um car@@ bon@@ ate .
well for the sa@@ ke of time , i want to focus on just three strategi@@ es .
okay , that &apos;s sever@@ in ha@@ cker .
well let me tell you , in terms of changing the world there has been a lot of competition this year , because the arab spring is still spre@@ ading , the euro@@ zone has collap@@ sed ... what else ?
b@@ l : this bacteria that we &apos;ve been talking about turns out to be the most simpl@@ est form of life found .
farmers now , who used to have to spend half a day of back@@ breaking labor to find out if the market town was open , if the market was on , whether the product they &apos;d harv@@ est@@ ed could be sold , what price they &apos;d fe@@ tch .
you can tag them with proteins that light up when you light them .
now , when we first started talking to ok go -- the name of the song is &quot; this too shall pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expres@@ sed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
and lei@@ b@@ ni@@ z was the first person to really talk about building such a machine .
and his clin@@ i@@ cian said to me , &quot; if you want to know more about psychop@@ a@@ ths , you can go on a psychop@@ ath spo@@ tting course run by robert h@@ are who invented the psychop@@ ath che@@ ck@@ list . &quot;
now , what &apos;s happening is that as transi@@ stors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller , they no longer be@@ have like this .
now , ten comm@@ and@@ ments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
and , you know , it &apos;s a thing your piano teacher teach@@ es you , but we never had a science behind these kinds of things .
i &apos;m asking my friends from america to help with bringing nur@@ ses or doctors to help us out .
and we take it as , you know -- we look at it on a moral level , rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level .
and i hope , if nothing else , i &apos;ve convinced you that , one , we do in fact have a super@@ massive black hole at the center of the galaxy .
and so this is basically a song about lo@@ ops , but not the kind of lo@@ ops that i make up here .
and just as the j@@ ar full of water can go from liquid to soli@@ d depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules , so your brain can go from a state of being conscious to a state of being un@@ conscious , depen@@ ding on the behavior of the molecules .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of atten@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess that she needed .
it &apos;s in not@@ ting h@@ ill next to all the cra@@ p -- you know , the pro@@ stit@@ utes and all that stuff .
and we knew we were right .
and to make them really stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical , let &apos;s make them both white guys .
and so , on a mi@@ cr@@ o level , there &apos;s a real role for this combin@@ ation of investment and phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y .
and here i think , &quot; wait a minute . &quot;
all right , pick one , last qu@@ est : sha@@ ke someone &apos;s hand for six seconds , or send someone a quick thank you by text , email , facebook or twitter . go !
tour@@ ist : i think that people are very fru@@ strated that they &apos;re not able to get closer to see what &apos;s going on .
and the answer is : not yet , they &apos;re working .
as it cop@@ ies itself , once in every billion r@@ ung@@ s , there ten@@ ds to be an er@@ ror .
that &apos;s one way of looking at it .
well , the answer seems to be , the universe can create complexity , but with great diffic@@ ul@@ ty .
if you hadn &apos;t noticed , our media climate generally provi@@ des a very di@@ stor@@ ted mirror of our lives and of our gender , and i think that &apos;s going to change .
se@@ vent@@ y percent of all antibio@@ tics consum@@ ed in america is consum@@ ed in animal hus@@ band@@ ry .
as political tur@@ mo@@ il in ye@@ men continu@@ es , the edi@@ tor of the ye@@ men times , na@@ dia al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f , talks at ted@@ global with ho@@ st p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell . al-@@ sa@@ k@@ ka@@ f &apos;s independent , engli@@ sh@@ -@@ language paper is vi@@ tal for sharing news -- and for sharing a new vision of ye@@ men and of that country &apos;s women as equal part@@ ners in work and change .
during this chap@@ ter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear cat@@ astrop@@ he , and an inde@@ li@@ ble image was implan@@ ted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st would be absolutely glob@@ ally de@@ struc@@ tive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it .
i &apos;m sc@@ ared . tell them to get away . &apos; &quot; as a young woman , i was in a psychiat@@ ric hospital on three different occasi@@ ons for l@@ eng@@ thy peri@@ ods .
because the way that he pres@@ ented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for s@@ ale right now .
so really , re@@ transl@@ ating that technology and developing something which was so clean , it was virtu@@ ally pollu@@ tion@@ -@@ free .
we have to turn it , go up and go down .
and mark t@@ wa@@ in , who knew all about typ@@ es@@ et@@ ting , really was s@@ mitten by this machine .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
this is the only fe@@ der@@ ally fund@@ ed site where it is legal to cul@@ tiv@@ ate can@@ n@@ ab@@ is for scientific research in the united states .
i travel@@ ed to iraq , afghanistan and liber@@ ia .
this was bad ! man , i was -- i c@@ ough . i was sick .
if you look at the regi@@ stry , actually , a lot of the regi@@ ster@@ ed things in the e@@ .@@ u .
thro@@ wing over@@ board , as ball@@ ast , to change our direction .
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
so , when they get really used to that , we move on to the cro@@ ws coming back .
so , it &apos;s about 26 degrees . you can &apos;t see it from over there .
i was lucky because one , also , my mom did something that most women don &apos;t do .
if that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
and we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a mo@@ dic@@ um of intelligence to that .
we repe@@ ated the experiment with the same two groups , this time ad@@ ding a del@@ ay between the time we told subje@@ cts how we would use their data and the time we actually started ans@@ wer@@ ing the questions .
so i would encoura@@ ge you all to gra@@ b some pla@@ y-@@ do@@ h , gra@@ b some s@@ alt , gra@@ b some sugar and start playing .
so you can get kind of a feel for this .
but these are early in@@ corpo@@ ra@@ tions of illu@@ sions brought to -- sort of high point with h@@ ans hol@@ bein &apos;s &quot; am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ ors . &quot; and h@@ ans hol@@ bein worked for henry vi@@ ii . this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the sta@@ ir and you can see this hidden sk@@ ul@@ l .
so this is the prepar@@ ation that one of my former post-@@ do@@ cs , gab@@ y ma@@ im@@ on , who &apos;s now at rock@@ ef@@ eller , developed , and it &apos;s basically a flight simul@@ ator but under conditions where you actually can stick an electro@@ de in the brain of the fly and record from a gene@@ tically identi@@ fied neuron in the fly &apos;s brain .
the first thing he said was he saw a hand@@ ker@@ ch@@ ie@@ f in mi@@ da@@ ir .
and as a blind person , your visual memory fa@@ des and is re@@ placed with how you feel about things and how things sound and how things smell .
no need of sta@@ ying with me all the day pus@@ hing my wheel@@ chair . &quot;
well , i noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at .
so , now we have , immediately , a re@@ al-@@ time map showing where there are re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps -- rapi@@ dly became the best map to use if you &apos;re doing re@@ lief work in port@@ -@@ au@@ -@@ prin@@ ce .
that &apos;s the first invention that i wanted to describe .
and you have people who gui@@ de those computers to do their c@@ ler@@ ical jobs .
so it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
fire@@ works dis@@ plays , the smell of per@@ fu@@ me : no .
it per@@ si@@ sts for months and o@@ f@@ ten@@ times for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
but we have , somehow , in the course of the last few cent@@ u@@ ries , or even decades , started to cul@@ tiv@@ ate an image of a my@@ th@@ ical , rural agri@@ cultural past .
it &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
in that ex@@ act same period that we &apos;ve been using these dr@@ ones with de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing accu@@ ra@@ cy , the number of attac@@ ks , of su@@ i@@ cide attac@@ ks and terror@@ ist attac@@ ks , against american forces in afghanistan has increas@@ ed ten@@ fold .
i said , &quot; well , that &apos;s very nice .
for those without dis@@ abilities , at age three , they &apos;re trans@@ fer@@ red to another institution , and at age seven , to yet another . se@@ gre@@ g@@ ated according to age and gender , they are arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily separ@@ ated from their si@@ bl@@ ings , often without even a chance to say go@@ od@@ b@@ ye .
essentially , he said this : &quot; if you bet on god , and open yourself to his love , you lose nothing , even if you &apos;re wrong .
that &apos;s k@@ ell@@ ar au@@ tu@@ m@@ n , my former ph@@ .@@ d. student , professor now at le@@ wi@@ s and c@@ lar@@ k , literally giving his fir@@ st-@@ born child up for this test .
well i &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
why do we argue ? to out@@ -@@ reason our op@@ pon@@ ents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosop@@ her dan@@ iel h@@ . co@@ hen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- mis@@ ses out on the real benefits of eng@@ aging in active dis@@ agre@@ ement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
a handy thing to have , because language is infin@@ ite , and you can &apos;t just par@@ rot back the sent@@ ences that you &apos;ve heard .
yes , it means i didn &apos;t have to draw g@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ ho@@ er@@ u .
perfectly nice thing to do .
and she &apos;s very important in my life , because she &apos;s the one that told me to leave mit and go to art school .
imagine you &apos;re using the internet and you see a cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a that you think is some@@ what pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar , like this cap@@ t@@ ch@@ a .
it &apos;s not that i think that spo@@ ken word poetry is the ide@@ al art form .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble . it &apos;s a pro@@ of of our fail@@ ing to save them in the wild .
this is a mouse created by charles vac@@ ant@@ i of the university of mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts .
that is the absolute wrong thing to ask , to tell kids to never be wrong .
so the idea was that we would be working on whatever we &apos;re working on , at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m@@ . the students flow in and you put down what you &apos;re doing , or you trade , or you work a little bit later or whatever it is .
that &apos;s based on diet in@@ take sur@@ ve@@ ys , it &apos;s based on levels of o@@ bes@@ ity , it &apos;s based on a range of fac@@ tors that gives you an appro@@ x@@ ima@@ te guess as to how much food is actually going into people &apos;s mou@@ ths .
so you can then map function onto structure , and then find out what the circu@@ it@@ ry &apos;s doing to generate that particular function .
and one of the ast@@ on@@ ishing predic@@ tions of quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that descri@@ bes transi@@ stors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reach@@ ed the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.@@ 4 times the mass of the sun .
so a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the py@@ th@@ ag@@ ore@@ an theor@@ em , which is a truly sub@@ tle and interesting pro@@ of , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
and here is this , then , young man called wil@@ ly bo@@ h@@ m who worked for the us@@ aid .
su@@ z@@ an@@ ne , just a curi@@ osity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
except that they &apos;re not as rich as ours , because they don &apos;t have a cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex like we do .
the sil@@ ver lin@@ ing is , i think , kind of the reason that behavi@@ oral economics is interesting and exciting .
but in all seri@@ ousness -- because this idea is birth@@ ed in ted , i would like it to be a leg@@ acy of ted , and i &apos;d like to call it the &quot; international system for total early disease dete@@ ction . &quot;
just that little bit of money , which to me , i wish it was in my bank account -- it &apos;s not , but ...
because of course , sometimes we do make decisions that have ir@@ re@@ vo@@ c@@ able and terrible consequences , either for our own or for other people &apos;s health and happiness and li@@ ve@@ li@@ ho@@ ods , and in the very worst case scen@@ ari@@ o , even their lives .
living with a physical dis@@ ability isn &apos;t easy anywhere in the world , but if you live in a country like the united states , there &apos;s certain app@@ ur@@ ten@@ an@@ ces available to you that do make life easier .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing clo@@ g@@ ging up a light so@@ cket .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . well , alle@@ ge@@ dly there &apos;s nothing .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good lu@@ ck .
but the idea is , like , on a newspaper , for example , we show you relevant ads .
a@@ v : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really res@@ u@@ b@@ mit yourself to these high@@ s and lo@@ ws -- the high@@ s being the first steps , the first s@@ mile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lo@@ ws being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
the real key obser@@ vation he made is that a fre@@ e-@@ flying wing can swe@@ ep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fix@@ e@@ d-@@ wing tur@@ bine .
&quot; we have no competition . there &apos;s nobody else who &apos;s ever made a wid@@ get like this . &quot;
the other condition is in societies living in mar@@ g@@ in@@ al or flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating environments , such as the arc@@ tic or deser@@ ts , where there are peri@@ o@@ di@@ c food shor@@ tages , and occasi@@ on@@ ally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
and when they do , i &apos;m in the qu@@ eu@@ e .
and a social movement is com@@ pris@@ ed , in my view , it &apos;s com@@ pris@@ ed of four main characteri@@ stics .
pac@@ k@@ aging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
so in every car crash in which at least one person dies , they have information on all of the people .
we should treat it carefully and with respect , and we do not want to m@@ ess with it , say by c@@ -@@ se@@ ctions or by antibio@@ tics or exc@@ essi@@ ve cle@@ an@@ lin@@ ess , without some real good justi@@ fication .
so let me just tell you , the great part of all of this ?
and , you know , built the society that we now live in .
these women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &apos;s not enough .
but then as it gets closer to the tree , look at the clo@@ se@@ -up . and see if you can see it land .
you can train a fly to avoid an od@@ or , shown here in blue , if you pair that od@@ or with a sho@@ ck .
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fi@@ fe ac@@ cent .
we already have the data showing that it redu@@ ces the du@@ ration of your flu by a few hours .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
in fact , even back during the an@@ ci@@ ents , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagra@@ m like this .
and this is the fourth time , and i come here for this wisdom , i think .
hi . so , this cha@@ p here , he thinks he can tell you the future .
but if corruption cre@@ e@@ ps in and people don &apos;t have the opportunity to have that protection of the rule of law , then if you can use violence , if you can use violence with im@@ pun@@ ity , you can reach out and harv@@ est the vulnerable into sla@@ very .
fe@@ min@@ ism has never been sex@@ y , but let me as@@ sure you that it never stopped me from fli@@ r@@ ting , and i have sel@@ dom suff@@ ered from lack of men .
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
so the challenges of education in this kind of place are not to learn the k@@ ings and que@@ ens of kenya or britain .
val@@ ence means good or bad , positive or negative .
and i started to see the world in a whole new way , like pa@@ irs of people connected to each other .
many soci@@ ologists like ve@@ bl@@ en and wol@@ fe would argue that the reason why we take orig@@ ins so seriously is because we &apos;re s@@ no@@ bs , because we &apos;re focused on status .
now that &apos;s not quite true . there &apos;s one other way , and that &apos;s through swe@@ ating .
so , first of all , dan , do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are ?
and they could be extin@@ ct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
it &apos;s our own pon@@ d . and that &apos;s how it happens . &quot;
and we know that there are more .
i have to say , it wasn &apos;t exactly what i had in mind for my first day down under .
first of all , most of them were born in the 8@@ 0s and 9@@ 0s , under the one-@@ child policy .
systems like the ones that we were creating on the fly could exist ahead of time .
but it vis@@ ited ju@@ pit@@ er , saturn , ur@@ an@@ us and ne@@ p@@ tun@@ e .
i walk around and encoura@@ ge them , &quot; come on , come on ! &quot; they have to write like crazy for an hour or two .
&quot; pa@@ p@@ i , help . &quot;
workers are treated as well or as b@@ ad@@ ly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot;
the architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation was frank@@ ly just du@@ m@@ b .
and so it was simply ast@@ on@@ ishing to me to find an organization that actually appreci@@ ated both those sides .
and i remember looking into the ice , and there were big ch@@ un@@ ks of white ice in there , and the water was completely black .
that &apos;s what he was doing , pro@@ pping up the bed because the bed simply didn &apos;t work .
this was one of the great things about my year , doing the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h , because i am a wor@@ ka@@ ho@@ lic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
shoes for ni@@ ke , where the up@@ pers are pol@@ ye@@ sters , infin@@ itely recycl@@ able , the bot@@ tom@@ s are bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able sol@@ es .
so while you &apos;re sitting around with the other patients in your pa@@ jam@@ as and everybody &apos;s p@@ ale and thin and you &apos;re waiting for your turn to get the gam@@ ma ra@@ ys , you think of a lot of things .
so , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that cro@@ ws are really , really intelligent .
so all the ex@@ qu@@ is@@ itely deta@@ iled calcu@@ lations we can do with that wonderful equ@@ ation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
and so , as a cancer doctor , instead of having paper in my ch@@ art , in your ch@@ art , and it being this thi@@ ck , this is what data flow is starting to look like in our off@@ ices , where that drop of blood is creating gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data .
and then you can also engage the end user in the design process , and not just ask him what he needs , but ask him how he thinks it can be achie@@ ved .
i &apos;m like , &quot; get it off ! don &apos;t worry about it , you know .
and it &apos;s too cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l to anima@@ te gu@@ ts and he@@ arts and behavior when the going gets r@@ ough .
i &apos;ll give you some a@@ sto@@ unding things that have happened as we started this .
my mother comes out , and he as@@ ks her for money , but she doesn &apos;t have enough .
that &apos;s a challenge . i like this .
i thought about this in the sense that it &apos;s great to build in biological materials , but can we do similar things ?
companies like national instru@@ ments , who are em@@ bed@@ ding very powerful , inter@@ active simu@@ lations into the materials , so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of text@@ book to an experience that all the teaching materials are things you can actually interact with and play around with and actually learn as you do .
the people who are attra@@ cted to these cour@@ ses typically have a ha@@ cker ment@@ ality .
the audience is led to make assu@@ mp@@ tions or el@@ abor@@ ations that are perfectly reas@@ on@@ able , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
so collabor@@ ative work , whether it &apos;s immediately co-@@ lo@@ cated or dist@@ ant and distin@@ ct , is always important .
and nor@@ way , swe@@ den , den@@ mark and fin@@ land now r@@ ank among the top six most competi@@ tive nations on earth , and they work the kind of hours that would make the average american we@@ ep with en@@ vy .
about 10 years ago , i was at a cock@@ tail party with a friend of mine , and we &apos;re sitting there , and he was com@@ pla@@ ining about the cro@@ ws that he had seen that were all over his y@@ ard and making a big m@@ ess .
last year alone , 99 fe@@ der@@ ally dec@@ lar@@ ed dis@@ ast@@ ers were on fi@@ le with fe@@ ma , from j@@ op@@ lin , mis@@ sour@@ i , and t@@ us@@ cal@@ o@@ o@@ sa , al@@ ab@@ ama , to the central texas wild@@ fir@@ es that just happened recently .
who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a co@@ w . nobody .
and later this year , the ra@@ il minister was sac@@ ked and sent@@ enced to ja@@ il for 10 years .
cha@@ z e@@ bert : it was cha@@ z who stood by my side through three attemp@@ ts to re@@ constru@@ ct my ja@@ w and re@@ store my ability to speak .
br@@ un@@ o bow@@ den , who &apos;s here , did that , broke the world recor@@ d.@@ em : con@@ gr@@ at@@ u@@ lations .
look at this young be@@ an that is moving to catch the light every time .
we stopped ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ating our soil , as much as we could .
now , this is the very interesting part .
no butt@@ ons to push , no tri@@ g@@ gers to pull , just me and the game .
so the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully hon@@ est@@ y for the sa@@ ke of hon@@ est@@ y , but a hope that by being more honest and can@@ did about these experiences , that we can all colle@@ c@@ tively b@@ end that happiness bas@@ eline up a little bit .
my father , who i &apos;ve been talking about , died of aids in 199@@ 9 .
the fact that there are ex@@ cep@@ tions here does not change that at all .
and what we &apos;re looking at is the pres@@ ence of the gas me@@ than@@ e , ch@@ 4 , in the atmosphere of mars .
teacher : now move it either side . see what happens .
the viet@@ na@@ m prote@@ sts , the com@@ memor@@ ation of all that died in the pan@@ de@@ mic of aids , the mar@@ ch for women &apos;s re@@ productive rights , right up until almost the present .
after i was invited by ted , i did some dig@@ ging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my ho@@ st .
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in continu@@ ously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with po@@ w@@ der now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bom@@ bar@@ ded by micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites , and when micro@@ me@@ te@@ or@@ ites come in at about 20 to 6@@ 0,000 miles an hour , they va@@ po@@ ri@@ ze on contact .
now i know there &apos;s been a whole lot of h@@ yp@@ e about our power to control biology .
every ho@@ li@@ day i had as a young boy was in a national park .
so i called the human@@ e society and i say , &quot; look , i &apos;m going to be ca@@ str@@ ating some lam@@ bs , can you tell me the deal ? &quot;
in fact , i use basically the same technology as this 14@@ th-@@ century classroom .
dinosau@@ r evolution proce@@ e@@ ded at a stat@@ ely p@@ ace , an order of magni@@ tude slo@@ wer on any way you want to measure it .
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
how many of you did it by ro@@ tat@@ ing the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it mat@@ ched up with the one on the right ?
it &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromo@@ some is cor@@ rec@@ tly posi@@ tioned .
so hopefully tomorrow i &apos;ll show one or two more objects from the stage , but for today i just wanted to say thank you for all the people that came and talked to us about it .
but what was interesting about this position i found myself in in ari@@ zon@@ a , was i had this really in a truly public school , and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities .
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &apos;t disc@@ uss universal access to hiv &#91; medicine &#93; for that qu@@ inti@@ le up here with the same strategy as down here . the impro@@ vement of the world must be highly con@@ tex@@ tu@@ alized , and it &apos;s not relevant to have it on regi@@ onal level . we must be much more deta@@ iled .
the answer is yes , and for the first time , it &apos;s my pleasure to be able to share two examples .
and he spoke to the crowd in chicago , he said , &quot; if there is anyone out there who still dou@@ b@@ ts that america is a place where all things are possible ... &quot;
and as i sat con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating what to say , a woman approach@@ ed in a black sha@@ w@@ l and black ro@@ be .
and our test pilot gave us the best feedback you can get from a test pilot after a first flight , which was that it was &quot; remark@@ ably un@@ remarkable . &quot;
this is something we &apos;ve actually known for a while , so it &apos;s not a real break@@ through .
and i think that it &apos;s going to be , in time , the elements of the human spirit that we &apos;ve been hearing about bit by bit by bit from so many of the speak@@ ers in the last few days .
but , both of these sa@@ y@@ ings -- saving a fish from dro@@ w@@ ning , or saving a man from dro@@ w@@ ning -- to me they had to do with inten@@ tions .
and i think that &apos;s a mistake .
it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the de@@ bt , so for five years , six years , i only had to pay one third income ta@@ x .
so there is the pattern that every one of them had , but they all were a little different too .
and they tried everything they had .
am@@ on@@ gst them a yellow co@@ at with white fu@@ r , a yellow and black bo@@ di@@ ce , and you see these clo@@ th@@ es on lots of other pain@@ t@@ ings , different women in the pain@@ t@@ ings , ver@@ meer &apos;s pain@@ t@@ ings .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscop@@ ic dep@@ ths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have addi@@ tional cur@@ led up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don &apos;t see them .
if they &apos;re bad , they &apos;re your creation . learn from it .
now , 5@@ 7 times 6@@ 8 is 3@@ ,@@ 400 , plus 4@@ 7@@ 6 is 3@@ 8@@ 7@@ 6 , that &apos;s 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 , 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 60 plus 17@@ 1 is 3@@ 8@@ ,@@ 9@@ 3@@ 1 .
and there are three ways , i think , that these massi@@ ve-@@ passi@@ ve data can be used .
&quot; look kid . i had a dream once , too , but -- but . &quot;
so the question is , how do you rein@@ vent something that has been around for five mil@@ len@@ nia ?
there &apos;s a thing that happens when you m@@ old and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silic@@ one and cast it in res@@ in , you lose a little bit of volu@@ me , you lose a little bit of size .
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
so when i thought about it , then suddenly i realized that biology gave us the answer .
but because i had no family to in@@ qui@@ re about me , they could do anything to me .
we were hop@@ ing that it w@@ ass going to have a kind of evil , spi@@ der@@ y walk , but instead it created this pretty l@@ ame way of moving forward .
i didn &apos;t quite get it . and paul rand was a kind of cru@@ sty designer , you know , a cru@@ sty designer , like a good -- kind of like a good french bread ?
prime numbers , g@@ aus@@ s , one of my favor@@ ites .
and then i think the other point is that indi@@ ans today are far more comfortable with glob@@ alization .
win bu@@ t@@ ler : now our lives are changing fast now our lives are changing fast hope that something p@@ ure can last hope that something p@@ ure can last o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait o@@ oh we used to wait sometimes it never came sometimes it never came still moving through the pain we used to wait for it we used to wait for it we used to wait for it ak : so i think , if there &apos;s one thing to take away from my talk today , it &apos;s that an interface can be a powerful narra@@ tive device .
and just down the road , this is je@@ t .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
she was s@@ mil@@ ing . she did not understand why i was so worried .
they have 22 satelli@@ tes zi@@ pping around at plus or min@@ us 100 miles , and the site &apos;s in red .
we &apos;re learning how to communicate with them , in really high-@@ pit@@ ched t@@ ones .
so gl@@ u@@ ck@@ s@@ berg did another experiment similar to this where he pres@@ ented the problem in a slightly different way , like this up here . okay ?
the standard explan@@ ation is that the universe somehow spr@@ ang into existence , full of a strange kind of energy -- in@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary energy -- which ble@@ w it up .
well , to end on a very positive note , i think evolution@@ arily speaking , this is probably a fairly good thing , in the end .
that &apos;s some more evidence , so in some sense -- i was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed by a scientist , who said , &quot; you could never publi@@ sh a study with an n of 4 , &quot; meaning those four cr@@ as@@ hes .
and he said , &quot; oh , i teach at a college of arts .
a three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half foot thing , beautiful sk@@ ul@@ l , predat@@ or , me@@ at@@ -@@ e@@ ater , a two-@@ leg@@ ged animal .
it &apos;s a h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st of a different kind , and hi@@ ding under our des@@ ks isn &apos;t going to help .
we believe that the sta@@ kes are high , but that the re@@ turns will be even greater .
but the problem is , you get hun@@ gry , so it &apos;s hard to keep it off .
resol@@ u@@ tions , smo@@ ke .
and then i can &apos;t tell you how hard it is to do that radi@@ ator , which is cur@@ ved .
tell a kid you &apos;re sorry , they &apos;re in sho@@ ck .
and with a friend of his , he took it upon himself to fre@@ e-@@ clim@@ b a red@@ wood without rop@@ es or any equipment to see what was up there .
great . cool . so i was really interested in quanti@@ ty .
ben sa@@ under@@ s : yeah , hi , ben sa@@ under@@ s .
i showed a nor@@ man rock@@ well painting before , and this one i grew up with , looking at constantly .
with a thousand juli@@ Ã¡@@ ns working together , mexico would be a very different country .
and i think that &apos;s probably right .
it &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
the more poli@@ te ones said , &quot; well , you know , indi@@ ans make good software progra@@ mm@@ ers and accoun@@ tan@@ ts , but they can &apos;t do the creative stuff . &quot;
wish i could .
the first is that the most important political value for the chinese is unity , is the ma@@ inten@@ ance of chinese civilization .
if you look at birds , which live a long time , cells from the birds tend to be more resi@@ stant to a lot of different environmental st@@ res@@ ses like high temperature or hydro@@ gen per@@ o@@ xide , things like that .
and that gives me hope because people are not pur@@ ely sel@@ fish .
we were talking about , my friends in brazil , how we scale up this model in china and brazil .
and mom@@ s gra@@ b their kids out of the way and say , &quot; don &apos;t st@@ are ! &quot;
au@@ d@@ re l@@ or@@ de once said , &quot; the white fa@@ thers taught us to say , &apos; i think , therefore i am . &apos; &quot; she suggest@@ ed , &quot; i feel , therefore i am free . &quot;
today , in swe@@ den and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot;
anyway , moving along .
and obviously there &apos;s been tremendous practical appli@@ cations associated with this world -- things like the er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation of small@@ po@@ x , the ad@@ vent of a v@@ acc@@ ine against cer@@ vi@@ cal cancer , which we now know is mostly caused by human pa@@ pil@@ lo@@ ma@@ virus .
can you feel their an@@ ger , their fear , their ra@@ ge at what has happened in their country ?
and the idea is so simple , so obvious , but i think the consequences are really profound .
well , here is the image .
though it &apos;s actually true , you know , the reason i &apos;m talking to you right now is because i was born in brazil .
and if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 sc@@ ales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add pl@@ ates to the back of a tur@@ tle , or to@@ es .
thank you . thank you .
and i don &apos;t want to spend your time in going through the details , but in the lower ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner , you see an example of the kind of thing that we have .
the other thing that i think is really important : a lot of national security policy isn &apos;t just about foreign policy , but it &apos;s about bud@@ gets , military bud@@ gets , and how the deb@@ ts of countries work out .
now , if you like to represent this zero and one of bin@@ ary , you need a device .
so you know how it ended up , spen@@ cer tra@@ cy brought a computer , a ma@@ infra@@ me computer of 195@@ 7 , in to help the libr@@ ari@@ ans .
i then went on wondering whether i could actually replace her image , so i got a loo@@ k-@@ ali@@ ke of di@@ ana and posed her in the right posi@@ tions and an@@ gles and created something that was in , or exi@@ sted in , the public imagination .
the next moment , as soon as they finished and disappe@@ ared into the sha@@ do@@ ws , a young man with a pro@@ pan@@ e lan@@ tern came on , hung it up on a tree , set up a cur@@ tain .
and again , it &apos;s fully inter@@ active , so you can ro@@ tate and you can look at things in real time on these systems here .
when life brought about a series of death and ne@@ ar-@@ death experiences within my close circle , which high@@ ligh@@ ted the need for an emergen@@ cy medical response service in india , similar to 9@@ 11 in usa .
so what we &apos;ve been doing in the united states is re@@ vie@@ wing the data -- end@@ less@@ ly re@@ vie@@ wing the data .
a culture which is top@@ -@@ down , ow@@ ned , where the vo@@ cal ch@@ or@@ ds of the millions have been lost .
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named bar@@ ack obama .
number three : the hand@@ ou@@ ts you give are not your pres@@ entation .
in sur@@ ve@@ ys of european and american ex@@ ecu@@ tives , fully 85 percent of them ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that they had issues or concern@@ s at work that they were afraid to raise .
there are various things in here : i could say we might raise more re@@ venue , or medical innovation will make the spending even higher .
no ce@@ o , no fir@@ m responsible , sing@@ ly , for building it .
and our main idea was to sort of sam@@ ple the seven most significant mountains of the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of a@@ zer@@ ba@@ i@@ j@@ an and rein@@ ter@@ pre@@ t them into urban and architec@@ tural structures , in@@ habit@@ able of human life .
so we gave them c@@ ameras ; they went around cam@@ pus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite profess@@ ors and their dor@@ m room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have harvard memor@@ ies of .
d@@ j : now one of the big things , of course , everybody knows that cat@@ s hate water , and so this was a real re@@ vel@@ ation for us .
and what &apos;s even more dist@@ ur@@ bing is what &apos;s happening with yo@@ unger boys .
4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one reti@@ re@@ e who was experi@@ en@@ cing de@@ bili@@ tat@@ ing disease .
the real social innovation i want to talk about invol@@ ves char@@ ity .
and if you watch these little fel@@ lo@@ ws vi@@ br@@ ating around -- they &apos;ll be there in a second -- right there , notice that they way they vi@@ bra@@ te is affected by the geome@@ try of the extra dimensions .
2011 was a year of extraordinary peop@@ le-@@ powered resi@@ stance , starting with arab spring and spre@@ ading across the world . how did this resi@@ stance work so well ? s@@ r@@ d@@ ja po@@ po@@ vi@@ c la@@ ys out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from non@@ violent tac@@ tics to a sense of humor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
there are important distribu@@ tional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think .
one re@@ de@@ em@@ ing fe@@ ature is it &apos;s li@@ f@@ ted up off the ground and it &apos;s got this vo@@ id , and it &apos;s got an empty core kind of in the spirit and that fac@@ ade very much corpo@@ rate and fe@@ der@@ al style .
and it &apos;s only when it goes wrong that we start to realize the importance of families to children .
and that &apos;s what the song is asking .
and then , because the ju@@ ven@@ il@@ es are in my colle@@ ction , i cut them open and look inside .
there &apos;s little bro@@ ch@@ ures all around outside , and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future , i be@@ g that you pick up that bro@@ ch@@ ure .
and i want you to rele@@ ase that negative energy by sha@@ king it from side to side .
and mer@@ ging them together to make the final quant@@ um theory of space and time and gravity , is the cul@@ min@@ ation of that , something that &apos;s going on right now .
and because the life cast , or the b@@ ust -- the ma@@ qu@@ ette -- of ben@@ jam@@ in was made from bra@@ d , we could trans@@ pose the data of bra@@ d at 4@@ 4 onto bra@@ d at 8@@ 7 .
it was significant for another reason . this is an international mission , and this event was cele@@ br@@ ated in europe , in germany , and the cele@@ br@@ atory pres@@ ent@@ ations were given in english acc@@ ents , and american acc@@ ents , and ger@@ man acc@@ ents , and french and itali@@ an and du@@ tch acc@@ ents .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
and how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascin@@ ates me .
now that sounds like an incredibly stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward question to answer , and that &apos;s what howard thought . because pe@@ p@@ s@@ i told him , &quot; look , we &apos;re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habit@@ able planet .
the one on the left comes from an orange surface , under direct light , facing to the right , vie@@ wed through a sort of a blu@@ ish medium .
men are rest@@ less , men are ambi@@ tious , men are comp@@ ul@@ si@@ vely mobile , and they all want a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate .
what you see , if you see the ti@@ tle called &quot; p@@ m &apos;s car held . &quot;
i know it works .
so again , they would say , &quot; well if we have access to non-@@ le@@ th@@ al weapons , if we &apos;ve got someone we know is ho@@ sti@@ le , we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place , at least , again , we &apos;re not going to kill them . &quot;
anthropo@@ log@@ ist wa@@ de da@@ v@@ is mus@@ es on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of the el@@ der brothers , a group of si@@ er@@ ra ne@@ v@@ ada indi@@ ans whose spi@@ ritual practice hol@@ ds the world in balance .
i think that cro@@ ws can be trained to do other things .
and so , these studies have docum@@ ented or suggest@@ ed out of a variety of important fun@@ ctions for the micro@@ bi@@ al community , this cloud , the non-@@ pa@@ tho@@ gens that live in and on us .
now , when i went to look at the fig@@ ures of the u.s. money supply , the u.s. money supply is the amount of dollars that the fe@@ der@@ al reser@@ ve prin@@ ts every year in order to satis@@ fy which , of course , refle@@ cts the growth of the economy .
when other people see my tat@@ too , for the most part they like how it looks .
i would argue , in britain there &apos;s a much better frame of re@@ ference , which is to tell people that more fir@@ st-@@ class mail arri@@ ves the next day in the u.k. than in germany .
i see this word , hear this word , feel this word everywhere .
so that &apos;s not so bad . i mean , even with two do@@ zen years , you open up your brow@@ ser and there &apos;s news of a signal , or you get a c@@ up of coffee .
it &apos;s true . it &apos;s true .
reach@@ ing success , i was pretty good at coming up with good ideas .
and they also are able to show and to exhi@@ bit such a wonderful and complex behavior that can be described just with the term of intelligence .
but i think it &apos;s in@@ san@@ e to believe that we will ever make a society that is genu@@ in@@ ely mer@@ it@@ o@@ cra@@ tic . it &apos;s an impossible dream .
and so there is a team of develop@@ ers from all over africa , who are part of this team now -- from ghana , from mal@@ aw@@ i , from kenya .
oh , and one more thing , and as an educ@@ ator , this is the one that really bo@@ thers me : if argument is war , then there &apos;s an impli@@ c@@ it equ@@ ation of learning with losing .
ma@@ sc@@ ul@@ in@@ ity mi@@ mi@@ cked by men who grew up with no fa@@ thers , cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage wor@@ n by bu@@ lli@@ es who are danger@@ ously ar@@ med but need hu@@ gs .
you might notice what we don &apos;t need to know : there &apos;s no history in here .
so i can see everything that ro@@ mo sees , and i get a robot &apos;@@ s-@@ e@@ ye@@ -@@ view of the world .
and when we do another round of this in my class this year , they will do better this time , because learning has to inclu@@ de an amount of failure , because failure is in@@ struc@@ tional in the process .
again , we are making holes in the sk@@ ul@@ l about the size of a di@@ me , putting an electro@@ de in , and then this electro@@ de is completely underneath the skin down to a pac@@ e@@ maker in the ch@@ est , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can ad@@ just how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain .
so we set up an experiment where@@ by we put a na@@ ked volunte@@ er in a large c@@ age , and in that c@@ age we rele@@ ased mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os to see where they were bit@@ ing on the body of that person .
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of con@@ fron@@ tation with a sort of dis@@ son@@ ant -- i suppose it &apos;s an electro@@ magnetic force that somehow gover@@ ns your par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of ar@@ c of your whole life .
this subje@@ cts food to a force about 5@@ 0,000 times that of normal gravity , and oh boy , does it cl@@ ari@@ fy chicken stock .
it &apos;s pretty . it &apos;s not bad . it &apos;s a huge tra@@ de@@ mark viol@@ ation , but it &apos;s pretty clever .
&apos;@@ in case you o@@ we one month , the land@@ l@@ ord will come with his hen@@ ch@@ men and b@@ und@@ le you out . he will con@@ fis@@ cate your things , &apos; arm@@ strong said .
there &apos;s one sector which isn &apos;t ex@@ posed to international trade , and which can generate a lot of jobs , and which is , in any case , a sensi@@ ble sector to exp@@ and , post-@@ conflict , and that is the construction sector .
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok &apos;s village , and she was gone .
well here &apos;s the late , great jer@@ ry and@@ rus &apos; &quot; impossible cra@@ te &quot; illusion in 3d , in which jer@@ ry is standing inside the impossible cra@@ te .
if you look like that , you look to the past , or you look inside if you are very flexi@@ ble , inside yourself .
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poor@@ est can we check population growth . this is the parado@@ x@@ ical answer that h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls at ted @ can@@ nes using color@@ ful new data display technology .
you see , the indi@@ ans also had a river that separ@@ ates the land of the living from the land of the dead .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
so for me , this project shows kind of how far we can go from some of those sort of small things that i was working on at the beginning of my career .
for me , what &apos;s truly s@@ und@@ ar about the idea of task shif@@ ting , though , isn &apos;t that it simply makes health care more acc@@ essi@@ ble and aff@@ ord@@ able but that it is also fundament@@ ally em@@ power@@ ing .
and then like kar@@ a@@ j@@ an . let &apos;s see what happens . okay ?
now , to make this more con@@ cre@@ te , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statisti@@ cally stick out in the most favorite ted@@ talks and in the least favorite ted@@ talks .
i was 27 . i thought i knew everything .
so how do we do this ? well , we use a model system that we term a proto@@ cell .
it &apos;s simply a little saying these people say before their me@@ al to re@@ mind them to stop eating when their sto@@ mach is &#91; 80 &#93; percent full .
i have to say , in those days , i couldn &apos;t really even find the bird .
because when you think about the importance , some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last s@@ ession we had about africa and his hypo@@ the@@ tical 50 billion dollars dest@@ ined for africa .
and she ser@@ ves it that way time and time again , and if you quar@@ re@@ l with her , she will say , &quot; you know what ? you &apos;re wrong ! this is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
so as we fle@@ w by away from it , we looked back . and guess what ?
last week , bill clin@@ ton at the ted a@@ wards said , &quot; this situation is un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented , un@@ equal , un@@ fair and un@@ stable . &quot;
kids just make photos in a class , the teacher recei@@ ves them , they pa@@ ste them on the school .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipu@@ late the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
it &apos;s one of many , many characteri@@ stics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
so , having seen this , and having worried about it for eight years , the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regul@@ atory guys , call a@@ ar@@ p , get an ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment right away .
if you &apos;re wired to make de@@ als , you make de@@ als .
and we did a survey that bac@@ ks up the fact that , you know , 45 percent of people in this very cru@@ cial demo@@ graphic in the u.@@ s .
i made the tough decision of going home after gradu@@ ation and not going up to capit@@ ol h@@ ill , but going down to my parents &apos; bas@@ ement and making it my job to learn how to paint .
and if you work with , in the right atmosphere , with humor , you have -- that &apos;s the pas@@ s@@ word to the co@@ s@@ mic bank of knowledge , where you can find any solution of any problem .
and when a big plant goes down , you lose a thousand me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts in milli@@ seconds , often for weeks or months , often without war@@ ning .
for example , there &apos;s particular em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on respect for the el@@ der@@ ly in east asia , associated with con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us &apos; doc@@ tr@@ ine of fi@@ li@@ al pie@@ ty , which means o@@ be@@ di@@ ence , respect and support for el@@ der@@ ly parents .
if you listen to the way black you@@ th today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot;
and as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
and then we are mis@@ er@@ able , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of be@@ ers and a ban@@ ana nu@@ t mu@@ ff@@ in .
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
but now we need a new fire that makes us safe , sec@@ ure , healthy and dur@@ able .
it makes sense , right ? there &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without wor@@ rying about creating noise or avo@@ i@@ ding t@@ all buildings .
it &apos;s the person that &apos;s sli@@ ding his hands up and down the le@@ vers , so the mechan@@ ism itself can be very simple and com@@ posed of bi@@ cycle parts you can get anywhere in the world .
so , i was able to stone one adul@@ ter@@ er .
and this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times che@@ aper than the current op@@ tions .
so it has nei@@ ther the resources , nor the in@@ centi@@ ves , to ho@@ ok up many other users .
and i was so excited -- first person i &apos;d ever see outside of e@@ b@@ be@@ ts field .
many people think the lines on the map no longer matter , but para@@ g k@@ han@@ na says they do . using maps of the past and present , he explains the ro@@ ot causes of bor@@ der confli@@ cts worldwide and pro@@ pos@@ es simple yet c@@ un@@ ning solutions for each .
you can &apos;t ask him how old he is because he has g@@ uns .
and just for ki@@ cks we ran his picture through the bal@@ ding , aging and weight gain software to see how he would look .
what i want to talk about is not that context is everything , but why is context everything .
for me , that was the white space ; that &apos;s what robots could not do yet .
as far as colle@@ ges go , there &apos;s about 3@@ 50 colle@@ ges around the world teaching video game cour@@ ses .
and then she goes , &quot; mom , do you think they would have , on the internet , any humans ma@@ ting ? &quot;
and where it doesn &apos;t , as in green@@ land in winter , mars is still not very far .
and not knowing where help was needed always en@@ su@@ red that help was in short supply in the areas that needed it most .
it thought of itself as being dis@@ connected from the internet , but it was possible for somebody to s@@ mu@@ g@@ gle a us@@ b drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ges , in that case , to actually destro@@ y themselves .
if we think of the dic@@ tion@@ ary as being the map of the english language , these bright spo@@ ts are what we know about , and the dark spo@@ ts are where we are in the dark .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .
of the 90 percent of the energy that mr. gore remin@@ ded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wa@@ sting our energy , intelligence and har@@ d-@@ ear@@ ned experience to that count .
corner row ra@@ il@@ way , station car park , front of a health center , people &apos;s front gar@@ dens , and even in front of the police station .
i esti@@ ma@@ ted that , just today , across the world , we spent about 10@@ 6 average world life@@ times teaching people how to calcu@@ late by hand .
ke@@ ats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pur@@ sue poetry , but he died when he was a year older than me .
here &apos;s the first battery -- a st@@ ack of co@@ ins , zin@@ c and sil@@ ver , separ@@ ated by car@@ d@@ board so@@ ak@@ ed in br@@ ine .
you know , we &apos;re going to do this , we &apos;re going to take it away from something else .
that feeling that no one is listening to me is very important in our relationships with technology .
we heat them up , we add a little bit of s@@ alt , we heat them up to almost bo@@ il@@ ing and cool them down , and as we cool them down , the short str@@ ands b@@ ind the long str@@ ands and start to form structure .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
i &apos;ve just described to you the one story behind that rec@@ tan@@ g@@ ular area in the middle , the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ lands , but every other green pat@@ ch on that has its own story .
and that &apos;s how we use the food l@@ ure in the hand , and we use food because we &apos;re dealing with ow@@ ners .
i mean , i see patients dying every day because we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on inside of them .
but i was still concerned , so i said , &quot; you know what , i &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
second , economic growth .
very , very sa@@ dly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &apos;s going on .
i &apos;m not supposed to be , like , walking down the a@@ is@@ le , and be like , &quot; hi , jack . &quot; you know , that &apos;s not cool .
we can understand how to understand the data from the micro@@ wave background radiation that was set down 13@@ .@@ 7@@ 2 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calcu@@ lations today to predict how it will look and it mat@@ ches .
now , if you take a game like war@@ craft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
so , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody as@@ ks you , &quot; where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
and they say , &quot; oh , yeah . const@@ ant acceler@@ ation .
if you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collabor@@ ative .
they &apos;re going to be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated if they sense they &apos;re wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly acc@@ used throughout the entire course of the interview , not just in flas@@ hes ; they &apos;ll be in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ated throughout the entire course of the interview .
she couldn &apos;t reach me . now she says she doesn &apos;t want to reach me because i &apos;m a go@@ d@@ less person .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at the gro@@ und@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my fir@@ m , have ever been involved in .
there &apos;s this thing , this milit@@ ari@@ zation of the world , and it &apos;s cen@@ ter@@ ed right in the united states .
oh , wonderful .
did you know that today we main@@ tain a global her@@ d of 60 billion animals to provide our meat , da@@ ir@@ y , eg@@ gs and lea@@ ther goods ?
so i think i &apos;m going to start with what i just heard .
but there &apos;s also a scientific reason that dro@@ ve this project , which was to use this natural lon@@ git@@ u@@ din@@ al data to understand the process of how a child lear@@ ns language -- that child being my son .
and you could look at this art and you could , of course , see the complex social organization of the people who brought it into being .
then i was so happy that i kept playing with the robot , and so you see the robot has a front ru@@ d@@ der here .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
ok , any six of them .
awful , really awful .
clearly the product you &apos;ve got has got to be safe to humans .
and that &apos;s why you &apos;re not going to have a great career , unless -- unless , that most ev@@ o@@ ca@@ tive of all english words -- unless .
i could do it again to show it one more time , but some would argue that this is a complete waste of the wh@@ is@@ key , and that i should rather drink it .
well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-@@ law told her son , &quot; i think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
the experience of down syndro@@ me people inclu@@ des those who are ac@@ tors , those who are wri@@ ters , some who are able to live fully indepen@@ d@@ ently in adul@@ tho@@ od .
much more vol@@ a@@ ti@@ le brown mu@@ star@@ d se@@ ed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more de@@ lic@@ ate aro@@ ma@@ tics . and what do they do ?
and their factory in china -- which probably is pretty clean -- is getting all of the ingre@@ di@@ ents from back@@ y@@ ard ab@@ at@@ to@@ irs , where families s@@ lau@@ ghter pig@@ s and extra@@ ct the ingre@@ dient .
so i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do .
so if you think about what it means to learn ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic or to learn to read , you &apos;re actually , literally re@@ writing your own brain .
and we &apos;ve introduced a pro@@ gr@@ ession dynamic into it , where , by going to the same place over and over , by doing challenges , by eng@@ aging with the business , you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen , and you eventually un@@ lock re@@ wards .
r@@ w : yes , this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it , for one thing .
you cannot comm@@ and compassion unless you become limit@@ less , and nobody can become limit@@ less , either you are or you are not . period .
and while this was the major difference between many initi@@ a@@ tives before to create change , before we thought , and governments told us -- and even sometimes it was true -- that change was im@@ posed on us , and people re@@ je@@ cted that , because they thought that it is alien to their culture .
it had occur@@ red on land , in rain@@ fore@@ sts of south america and africa , where lan@@ dow@@ ners had been paid not to cut the trees down .
and a boo@@ k@@ mobile -- the size of a van with a satelli@@ te dis@@ h , a prin@@ ter , bin@@ der and cu@@ tter , and kids make their own books .
but you do meet some fantastic people , people who look at the world in a totally different way .
thanks , scot@@ t .
this is wus@@ han , one of the largest cities that was rel@@ oc@@ ated .
if we ask einstein , he would say , &quot; whether the co@@ w cros@@ sed the road , or the road moved underneath the co@@ w , depen@@ ds on your frame of re@@ ference . &quot;
i &apos;m asking you , for these children , whose faces you see , they &apos;re no more .
now shared car services are also spr@@ inging up around the world , and these eff@@ or@@ ts , i think , are great .
unfortunately , it was the last thing she ever said to him , because she never saw him again . he did not survive .
i tried to look at where did the kind of learning we do in schools , where did it come from ?
whenever there is an ele@@ ction , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to che@@ at , or something goes acci@@ dent@@ ally aw@@ ry -- a bal@@ lot box goes missing here , cha@@ ds are left han@@ ging over here .
but we don &apos;t know where , since we don &apos;t know how to read the pattern .
because the off@@ ices are well equi@@ pped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
it is something to be great@@ ly optimi@@ stic about .
in our study , they are more positive , but they &apos;re also more likely than yo@@ unger people to experience mix@@ ed emotions -- sa@@ dness at the same time you experience happiness ; you know , that te@@ ar in the eye when you &apos;re s@@ mil@@ ing at a friend .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about co@@ ffe@@ e@@ houses for the last five years , because i &apos;ve been kind of on this qu@@ est to investi@@ gate this question of where good ideas come from .
now , when you think of a coral re@@ e@@ f , this is what most people think of : all these big , hard , el@@ abor@@ ate cor@@ als and lots of bright , color@@ ful fis@@ hes and things .
you &apos;ve got to pay for your so@@ ap , your de@@ o@@ dor@@ ant , to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , to@@ o@@ th@@ pa@@ ste , all of it .
modern medicine is in dan@@ ger of losing a powerful , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned tool : human touch . physi@@ cian and writer abra@@ ham ver@@ gh@@ ese descri@@ bes our strange new world where patients are mer@@ ely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-@@ on-@@ one physical ex@@ am .
because after about six months of me talking about this , i think he finally figured out that i was really serious about the pen@@ is thing .
and what &apos;d we do then ? well , i met nice people like you , and they invited us to the ham@@ p@@ tons .
there is another reason why we might be feeling more an@@ xi@@ ous , about our care@@ ers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
and the second is about some new dimension which i want to re@@ fer to , which has never quite happened in the way it &apos;s happening now .
and , inci@@ dent@@ ally , i call her the ele@@ an@@ or roo@@ se@@ v@@ elt of the right .
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-@@ tech green@@ house and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
a signal in the brain that tri@@ g@@ gers brain dy@@ s@@ function might be sen@@ sed as a tri@@ g@@ ger for electro@@ -@@ stimu@@ lation like we &apos;re doing with epi@@ le@@ p@@ sy .
today these low pri@@ ces are available in the 25 countries where we work , and in a total of 6@@ 2 countries , and about 5@@ 5@@ 0,000 people are getting the benefits of them .
i think it &apos;s the first step toward that . that &apos;s the long-term goal .
every time i read che@@ k@@ ho@@ v and his unique vision of human life , i &apos;m remin@@ ded of why i too became a writer .
because , as i said , we live our lives in networks , and these networks have a particular kind of a structure .
it makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from in@@ gest@@ ing po@@ ison should predict who i &apos;m going to vote for in the up@@ coming pres@@ identi@@ al ele@@ ction .
there are two villa@@ ges , har@@ r@@ is and mor@@ e@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called ta@@ g-@@ a-@@ giant , and together , fis@@ her@@ s worked with us to tag 800 to 9@@ 00 fish .
people with stro@@ kes and les@@ i@@ ons in the emotion@@ -@@ process@@ ing parts of the brain are not super smart , they &apos;re actually sometimes quite hel@@ pl@@ ess .
i was stru@@ ck immediately by the kin@@ dness and the gent@@ len@@ ess in her face , and i asked her to tell me her story .
from the fact that they are only ser@@ ving one audience , main@@ ly the western culture .
and if you walk faster , if i walk faster , it dete@@ cts what &apos;s called the time inter@@ val , which is the inter@@ val between each he@@ el li@@ ft .
there are really serious cal@@ am@@ i@@ ties star@@ ing us in the eye that we &apos;re in the same kind of den@@ ial about that we were about terror@@ ism , and what could &apos;ve happened on september 11 .
i saw the power of du@@ ke &apos;s song with urban you@@ th -- an audience , you know , i as a midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged professor , i don &apos;t have a hope of getting to -- in terms of convin@@ cing them of the importance of wild@@ lands .
&quot; many do not know the alp@@ hab@@ et or multi@@ pli@@ cation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ tic@@ ut scho@@ ol@@ teacher .
i was able to see that in a fir@@ sth@@ and way , when i went to beautiful d@@ ong village , in gui@@ z@@ ho@@ u , the poor@@ est pro@@ vin@@ ce of china .
after he died , i realized that no one wri@@ tes to me anymore .
right now , it &apos;s not . if you do spre@@ ad@@ she@@ ets and things at work , a word docum@@ ent , they aren &apos;t on the web , but they are going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of this machine .
and when that happens , that will transform the way we have to understand our past , our present and human culture .
so it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . it &apos;s not .
and so what the buil@@ der will get is every single individual part that has been cu@@ sto@@ m manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red off@@ -@@ site and deli@@ vered on a tru@@ ck to the site , to that buil@@ der , and a set of these instru@@ ction manu@@ als .
bene@@ ath that , i &apos;ll put a two-@@ b@@ y-@@ two square , and next to that , a three-@@ b@@ y-@@ three square , bene@@ ath that , a five-@@ b@@ y-@@ five square , and then an ei@@ ght-@@ b@@ y-@@ eight square , creating one giant rec@@ tan@@ gle , right ?
so as we go in here , what we start to see , apply the physics engine again , we see what &apos;s one conversation is actually com@@ posed of many smaller ones .
and it wouldn &apos;t be fun to talk about the space age without seeing a fla@@ g that was car@@ ried to the moon and back , on apo@@ ll@@ o 11 .
&quot; no , my daughter , she &apos;s coming in the bu@@ i@@ ck .
and la@@ stly , the only portra@@ it of a male that leon@@ ardo pain@@ ted , &quot; the musi@@ cian . &quot;
when you open up the front door , this is what you &apos;re looking at . it &apos;s pretty simple . it &apos;s a hole in the ground .
okay . now on the left you can see the hand -- that &apos;s the big ar@@ row -- and the pen@@ is on the right . the hand ho@@ vering .
move your eyes around , blin@@ k , maybe close one eye .
one is people need a guar@@ an@@ tee they won &apos;t be evi@@ cted .
and this is on@@ going work , but der@@ mat@@ ologists -- i mean , i &apos;m a der@@ mat@@ ologist .
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &apos;s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earli@@ est phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be .
hi there . i &apos;m has@@ an . i &apos;m an artist .
it &apos;s been repor@@ ted that wiki@@ lea@@ ks , your baby , has , in the last few years has rele@@ ased more classi@@ fied docum@@ ents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combin@@ ed .
the girls , to my hor@@ ror , a@@ ver@@ ted their ga@@ ze .
and just recently we &apos;ve made a break@@ through , where we now believe we &apos;re going to be able to create the first syn@@ thetic , self-@@ cle@@ an@@ ing , dry ad@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ ve . many companies are interested in this .
in fact , so many different points of res@@ on@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
but if they were together plan@@ ting trees for the environment , it was okay -- creativity .
i &apos;m really sc@@ ared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
she lives with all of that inse@@ curity , and in fact , in janu@@ ary , during the eth@@ ni@@ c ri@@ ots , she was ch@@ ased from her home and had to find a new sha@@ ck in which she would live .
up goes the bird , out come the words , &quot; ju@@ ani@@ to , ju@@ ani@@ to , ven@@ te a com@@ er m@@ i hi@@ jo ! &quot;
and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object fig@@ ures .
drugs of ab@@ use would come in , and they would change the way you value the world . they change the way you value the sym@@ b@@ ols associated with your drug of choice , and they make you value that over everything else .
so what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an asi@@ an person and a european person by looking at their ingre@@ di@@ ents list .
that means they &apos;re totally out of syn@@ c in traditional clas@@ ses , which are anal@@ o@@ g , sta@@ tic , inter@@ ac@@ tively passi@@ ve .
but whatever you do in that program , it has to be fully suppor@@ ted by the people , meaning that you also have to ad@@ just it to the local , cultural values .
i took it very literally , and took my bi@@ ke hel@@ met , put a little cut over there so that the proje@@ ctor actually f@@ its ni@@ c@@ ely .
so anybody who wants to copy us and come and join us , go for it .
there &apos;s a deep resi@@ stance because using these tools forces us to con@@ front that we &apos;re not a system , forces us to be@@ have with a different set of values .
it took me several months to design the colum@@ n , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calcu@@ late all of the 16 million faces .
we &apos;ve all learned what -- the kind of pan@@ ic that can occu@@ r when an old disease re@@ ars its head , like anth@@ ra@@ x .
and this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather re@@ bar@@ ba@@ tive tex@@ ts is a good d@@ ress re@@ he@@ ar@@ sal for doing the same in ordinary life .
more importantly , the force that i led was spread over more than 20 countries .
your model of the world is the filter . that &apos;s what &apos;s sha@@ ping us .
as many of you know , this is the com@@ position where the pian@@ ist si@@ ts at a ben@@ ch , op@@ ens up the piano and si@@ ts and does nothing for four minutes and 3@@ 3 seconds -- that period of sil@@ ence .
you , you can teach it .
wind power produ@@ ces a bit more , 2.@@ 5 wat@@ ts per square meter , but that &apos;s only twice as big as 1.@@ 25 wat@@ ts per square meter , so that means if you wanted literally to produce total energy consumption in all forms on average from wind far@@ ms , you need wind far@@ ms half the area of the u.@@ k .
and what was so gor@@ ge@@ ous about this discovery was 50 years ago peter hig@@ gs and his team considered one of the deep@@ est of all questions : how is it that the things that make us up have no mass ?
sk@@ ill number one is the ability to recognize success and the ability to recognize failure .
the re@@ p@@ tili@@ an part of our brain , which si@@ ts in the center of our brain , when it &apos;s thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed , it shu@@ ts down everything else , it shu@@ ts down the pre@@ fron@@ tal cortex , the parts which learn , it shu@@ ts all of that down .
so i can say , with some certain@@ ty , &quot; i think , therefore i am . &quot;
according to non-@@ govern@@ mental organizations that keep such statistics , since 19@@ 45 , in europe and the americ@@ as , there has been a ste@@ ep dec@@ line in inter@@ state wars , in de@@ ad@@ ly eth@@ ni@@ c ri@@ ots or po@@ gro@@ ms , and in military cou@@ ps , even in south america . worldwide , there &apos;s been a ste@@ ep dec@@ line in dea@@ ths in inter@@ state wars . the yellow b@@ ars here show the number of dea@@ ths per war per year from 19@@ 50 to the present .
that is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a se@@ cular trend which is very strong .
when i was 15 years old , it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger -- much bigger -- where i did the second part of secon@@ dar@@ y school .
and i thought , &quot; well , hey !
the main thing is a fi@@ x-@@ it@@ -@@ lo@@ cally culture , which is fantastic because it means that your product or your service doesn &apos;t have to go through a huge bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic system to get it fix@@ ed .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
well , this from &quot; the purpose driven life &quot; -- &quot; the bi@@ ble must become the auth@@ or@@ it@@ ative standard for my life , the comp@@ ass i rely on for direction , the coun@@ sel i listen to for making wise decisions and the ben@@ ch@@ mark i use for ev@@ al@@ u@@ ating everything . &quot;
beautiful sh@@ ell ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ac@@ es that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and cra@@ f@@ ts fair , as well as o@@ ch@@ re body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
what the climate crisis has reve@@ aled to us is a secon@@ dar@@ y , more insi@@ di@@ ous and more per@@ v@@ asi@@ ve crisis , which is the crisis of agen@@ cy , which is what to do .
it &apos;s so obvious , straight in your face , and somebody must have thought of it .
and all the burning of oil and coal and gas , all the fossil fu@@ els , have changed the atmosphere great@@ ly .
join us , come into that safe space , and let &apos;s start to make this happen .
and you can see at the top of the screen , there &apos;s a centi@@ pe@@ de sc@@ roll@@ ing across your computer when you get infe@@ cted by this one .
and i think when you look at the animal king@@ dom , that is one of the most remarkable things .
and so , if you think of cancer as a system , there &apos;s an input and an out@@ put and a state in the middle .
we just take se@@ a@@ water and we filter it , and we collect different size organisms on different fil@@ ters , and then take their dna back to our lab in rock@@ ville , where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours .
this is &quot; 6@@ ,@@ 500 y@@ ards , &quot; after cor@@ ot . &quot; 9@@ ,000 y@@ ards , &quot; after ger@@ hard ri@@ chter .
and we &apos;ve looked at everything : more aids cases , flu , etc .
so this mu@@ tual inspiration pro@@ mot@@ es collaboration , initiative and creativity .
these cor@@ als can be quite kind of mean , you see , and i have sur@@ fing sc@@ ars to prove that .
he is now a medical student at y@@ ale university , and he &apos;s con@@ tem@@ pl@@ ating a sur@@ gical career -- one of the first dea@@ f individuals to consider a career in surgery .
and if you remember the story about s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us , s@@ is@@ y@@ ph@@ us was pun@@ ished by the go@@ ds to push the same rock up a h@@ ill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
you can walk away , you can just watch as this character stands there in the bl@@ ender and looks at you , or you can actually choose to interact with it .
von ne@@ um@@ ann , and a logi@@ cian , and a mathemati@@ cian from the army put this together . then , they needed a place to build it .
so after being inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated by this japanese man@@ ager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; so , miss y@@ ang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot;
i was to the point where i was using a stop@@ watch and painting squ@@ ar@@ es out of rand@@ om@@ ness , and i wasn &apos;t getting anywhere . so i went back and du@@ mp@@ ed all my pain@@ t@@ ings in the ar@@ no , and i thought , i &apos;m going to just start playing around .
by the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
if however , we can go back and alter our relationship , re-@@ vision our relationship to past people and events , neu@@ ral path@@ ways can change .
and i sat down , and i began to write , and write , and write , even though i &apos;d gone there really to get away from my des@@ k .
and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-@@ quality cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um in our front po@@ cket .
this is bad news , but perhaps surprising to you , it &apos;s also part of the good news .
okay , i che@@ ated , it was a m@@ ere 20 seconds .
a vic@@ tor in a thousand con@@ tests , three great civil rights laws , medi@@ care , aid to education .
sometimes you get a little star appl@@ ause , and then i think even bill gates takes a nervous breath , and the talk begins .
gene even did a little ti@@ le work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from h@@ ills of korea to live happ@@ ily ever after in atlan@@ ta . &quot;
so i just thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to capture th@@ um@@ b@@ print , foot@@ print , or whatever tra@@ ces we leave as humans . &quot;
many thought that it was just impossible to make an aids v@@ acc@@ ine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
they &apos;re also going to ask you the question that when we knew that this was the way that hiv enter@@ ed into the human population , and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this , why did we let these behaviors continue ?
so , there &apos;s more and more activity near the boat , and all of a sudden somebody shou@@ ts , &quot; what &apos;s that in the water ? &quot;
that &apos;s how it works . that &apos;s why we don &apos;t see the long li@@ fes@@ pan , until we have the da@@ f-@@ 2 mu@@ t@@ ant .
and you all know what it is . you don &apos;t need to have a dis@@ ability to know that .
communication technologies : 50 different ways to measure this , the number of bits being moved around , the size of the internet .
one of them , from anthropo@@ log@@ y , is the study of human univer@@ s@@ als .
if you &apos;re thinking about people taking too much risk and not understanding how much risk they &apos;re taking or taking too little risk , we need to think about that .
compared to a rat , we might seem special , yes , but that &apos;s not a fair compar@@ ison to make , given that we know that we are not ro@@ dents .
and there are days -- i don &apos;t know about the rest of you guys -- but there are days when i pal@@ p@@ ably feel how much i rely on other people for pretty much everything in my life .
and in my mind , i realized as a sur@@ gical pi@@ one@@ er that the purpose of my position of influence was sur@@ ely to speak up for those who have no influence .
what is real is separ@@ at@@ eness , and at some point in early bab@@ y@@ hood , the idea of self starts to form .
so the problem became -- and they set this dile@@ m@@ ma to me -- that you have to design the inter@@ ior using only our exi@@ sting technology , and there &apos;s no money for to@@ ol@@ ing or mol@@ ding .
we can cut the stem -- ti@@ de the stem of this into our oceans and in doing so , save our oceans , save our planet , save ourselves .
genom@@ ics pi@@ one@@ er cra@@ ig vent@@ er takes a break from his epi@@ c ro@@ und@@ -@@ the-@@ world expedi@@ tion to talk about the millions of genes his team has discovered so far in its qu@@ est to map the ocean &apos;s bio@@ diversity .
so let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dis@@ se@@ ct some lessons from it .
and the man who talked at that ev@@ ening lec@@ ture was very interesting .
well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the surge@@ on has per@@ formed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
and if we study those h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ er tri@@ bes and the ne@@ anderth@@ al , which are very similar to early man , we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology , and this is a kind of a cur@@ ve of their average age .
a wise person knows how to impro@@ v@@ ise , as lu@@ ke did when he re-@@ was@@ hed the floor .
and certainly , nei@@ ther cri@@ ck or i were chemi@@ sts , so we tried to build a model . and he knew , fran@@ c@@ is knew wil@@ kins .
so if you &apos;re in drug discovery , for example , you can go through an entire li@@ sting of what the genome has on offer to find perhaps better drug tar@@ gets and optimi@@ ze .
that &apos;s a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do math , i &apos;m sure .
it will really make us question what it is to be a human being .
it is true that the internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and che@@ aper .
and also , when a scientist makes a discovery , he or she normally has no clu@@ e what the appli@@ cations are going to be .
and instead of that point and click , it &apos;s like a push and pull , things colli@@ de as you &apos;d expect them . just like on my real des@@ k , i can -- let me just gra@@ b these guys -- i can turn things into pil@@ es instead of just the fol@@ ders that we have .
in fact , as i looked into her case , i discovered to my surprise that it &apos;s not clearly illegal for you or me to put a tracking device on someone else &apos;s car .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
the global perspective is that up to 30 percent of children in school have learning we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses that are not self-@@ cor@@ rec@@ ting , but with appropriate treatment , they can be scre@@ en@@ ed for and dete@@ cted and cor@@ rec@@ ted and avoid their acade@@ mic failure .
this is a 20 man version for going to ju@@ pit@@ er : bun@@ ks , stor@@ m cell@@ ars , exercise room .
and it &apos;s very difficult to be happy on a planet that &apos;s ra@@ cked with fam@@ ine and dr@@ ought .
humans have lived for much , much longer than the appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely 10,000 years of sett@@ led agri@@ cultural civilization in small family groups . no@@ ma@@ di@@ c h@@ unter@@ s bring down rab@@ bits , gather@@ ing food .
and if you ask what kind of situation is condu@@ ci@@ ve to people defin@@ ing people as ene@@ mi@@ es , it &apos;s a zer@@ o-@@ sum situation .
we &apos;re using whatever le@@ verage we have to bring them to the table .
and what they noticed was they don &apos;t have a lot of d@@ v@@ rs , they don &apos;t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
in other words , if somebody tou@@ ches me , my hand , neuron in the so@@ ma@@ to@@ sensor@@ y cortex in the sensor@@ y region of the brain fir@@ es .
but it all starts with see@@ ds in class@@ rooms , in my place , which looks like this .
right . i go to the del@@ i ; i &apos;m sick ; i need to buy some medicine .
and that &apos;s what i look for in my work , a personal meaning .
it &apos;s sol@@ vable , not by being a demo@@ cr@@ at , not by being a republi@@ can .
and in che@@ es@@ e@@ ca@@ ke and all kinds of des@@ ser@@ ts , like cho@@ col@@ ate m@@ ous@@ se , ti@@ ra@@ mis@@ u , van@@ ill@@ a pu@@ d@@ ding , everything that &apos;s cool@@ ed in the super@@ market , there &apos;s gel@@ a@@ tin to make it look good .
so just to conclu@@ de , we &apos;ve got a lot of questions to ask , and like i said , we &apos;ll ask questions here , not answer them .
jen@@ ny is horri@@ fied at what she has done , but then the transl@@ ator explains that the patient &apos;s condition has nothing to do with the operation .
a@@ ph@@ or@@ ism enth@@ usi@@ ast and auth@@ or james ge@@ ary wa@@ xes on a fascinating fix@@ ture of human language : the metaphor . friend of scri@@ bes from ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le to el@@ v@@ is , metaphor can sub@@ tly influence the decisions we make , ge@@ ary says .
and now , in contr@@ ast to the la@@ par@@ o@@ scop@@ y , you can pre@@ cis@@ ely place the need@@ le in your instru@@ ments , and you can pass it all the way through and follow it in a tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
but i think we should also just check the numbers , take a reality check here .
all right , well thank you all so much for jo@@ ining us .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
and in the future , when it sees something similar to that again , so in a similar environment , or the ex@@ act same environment , it &apos;ll play it back . it &apos;ll start playing it back .
something , again , that went back to something more fundamental .
the shar@@ p , cris@@ p out@@ lines of this forma@@ tion make it the best one for finding shapes in .
bf : that &apos;s all right , he does that . all right .
and once a cre@@ ature po@@ ps into our minds , it &apos;s almost like the process of creation is to discover the way this cre@@ ature really wants to exist and what form it wants to take and what way it wants to move .
it &apos;s grown in my mind , and then it &apos;s grown in terms of the whole process that i go through .
just have a quick look . and what we need to realize is that every 300 base pa@@ irs in your dna , you &apos;re a little bit different .
well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough don@@ or cy@@ cles .
he was a sou@@ ven@@ ir sal@@ es@@ man who always wanted to be a pain@@ ter , and i was frank@@ ie p@@ . tor@@ onto .
so to cut the story short , i decided that i had to go back and do it .
step two : they teach the children the kor@@ an , which is islam &apos;s ho@@ li@@ est book , in arab@@ ic , a language these children do not understand and cannot speak .
and we have had a speak@@ er who said that very thing , and s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed a s@@ word right after that , which was quite dra@@ matic .
so there it was , th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning we stopped the pi@@ g &apos;s medic@@ ation and there is his electro@@ gra@@ m , the signal from inside the pi@@ g &apos;s heart coming out by radio tele@@ me@@ try .
and we can actually leave it out where it &apos;s not needed at all and where we can preser@@ ve dar@@ k@@ ness .
that &apos;s the inter@@ -@@ mon@@ soon , the time when the mon@@ soon changes .
they have kids of their own , and they &apos;ve achie@@ ved a genetic mira@@ cle by mar@@ rying beautiful people , so their grand@@ mom@@ s look like ger@@ tru@@ de stein , their dau@@ gh@@ ters looks like hal@@ le ber@@ ry -- i don &apos;t know how they &apos;ve done that .
it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; is .
most of the edu@@ cational games that are out there today are really flas@@ h@@ cards .
it &apos;s not fi@@ ction , it &apos;s not story tal@@ es , it &apos;s not ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe ; it &apos;s cold , hard science .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , m@@ yo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skelet@@ al muscle cells ?
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and lea@@ h and la@@ y@@ ma have hum@@ bled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assu@@ mp@@ tions of any kind .
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an a@@ ster@@ is@@ k , and the a@@ ster@@ is@@ k is that it ex@@ clu@@ des two thir@@ ds of the workers of the world .
what is this ? this is the first transp@@ l@@ ant of na@@ ked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , ins@@ ert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
so i &apos;ve color@@ ed in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in pur@@ ple . and you can see that the top repe@@ at unit can be expla@@ ined almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repe@@ at unit has a substan@@ tial amount of pur@@ ple .
i &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but i will not use digital technology , as i &apos;ve done during my first five ted@@ talks .
and anything that you can do to pro@@ mote that would be fantastic .
un@@ cle gets dr@@ un@@ k , doesn &apos;t use con@@ dom . come back , start again . &quot;
this man is supposed to represent a gener@@ ic human being , and all of the cir@@ cles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
we were in the desert , in wa@@ di r@@ um , in a small je@@ ep .
these are some designs from eric dre@@ x@@ ler &apos;s book -- which we &apos;re now showing are fe@@ asi@@ ble with super@@ -@@ computing simu@@ lations , where actually there are scientists building mole@@ cu@@ le-@@ scale robots .
this little boy will never step outside of the sac@@ red fields that surro@@ und the men &apos;s hu@@ t for all that time , until he begins his journey of initi@@ ation .
brian photograph@@ ed a marine san@@ c@@ tu@@ ary in new ze@@ al@@ and , where commercial fishing had been ban@@ ned -- the result being that the over@@ fis@@ hed species have been re@@ stor@@ ed , and with them a possible solution for sustainable fis@@ her@@ ies .
she grew up in a rural village in a poor area of india , and she was enga@@ ged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-@@ law &apos;s house .
i mean , i think most people in the industry understand that we &apos;ve got to get on with it .
dur@@ k@@ heim called this level the level of the sac@@ red because he believed that the function of religion was to uni@@ te people into a group , into a moral community .
and then you have to do the ini@@ tial sk@@ et@@ ch of the character , which is like your structure of a piece , and then you add pen and pen@@ cil and whatever details that you need -- that &apos;s poli@@ sh@@ ing the drawing .
this is going to be much more powerful than having a single ship in a single location , then move to a new location .
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
but this gives control to the provi@@ der , whether there &apos;s power or not , because they can ad@@ just the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they &apos;re giving their patient .
in this bra@@ cing talk , coral re@@ e@@ f ec@@ ologist jer@@ e@@ my j@@ ack@@ son la@@ ys out the sho@@ cking state of the ocean today : over@@ fis@@ hed , over@@ he@@ ated , pollu@@ ted , with indi@@ cat@@ ors that things will get much worse . ast@@ on@@ ishing photos and stat@@ s make the case .
and the lat@@ est thing that i &apos;m working on -- -- is something really -- i don &apos;t know what it is yet .
ok , so a computer pi@@ cks a specific it@@ em of data from memory , it sen@@ ds it into the process@@ or or the al@@ u , and then it puts the result back into memory .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
now , i was a little sc@@ ared because when you see those three problems , they seem really hard to deal with .
and i also like to say she &apos;s the only person who actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , so ...
one explan@@ ation is that the person doesn &apos;t have the disease -- that &apos;s over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly likely , if you pick someone at random -- but the test gets it wrong , which is un@@ likely .
in fact , in the last 10 years , the number of patients requ@@ ir@@ ing an organ has dou@@ bled , while in the same time , the actual number of transplan@@ ts has bar@@ ely gone up .
we had ful@@ l-@@ page adverti@@ se@@ ments , some 30 years , 25 years ago when this can@@ al came .
well , when i think of the future , i never see myself moving forward in time . i actually see time moving back@@ ward towards me .
at the opposite , everyone knows deep within that an act of sel@@ fl@@ ess gener@@ osity , if from the distance , without anyone knowing anything about it , we could save a child &apos;s life , make someone happy .
and , you know , once a tox@@ in is in the food chain everything is affected , including us .
an example , a great example , is the risk of smo@@ king .
i &apos;m showing it because -- they &apos;re not a spon@@ sor , are they ? -- because , in its own way , this is a cr@@ ass version of our fo@@ unding story .
now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingre@@ di@@ ents in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
&#91; chinese &#93; &quot; big sister w@@ ong , &quot; was@@ h@@ burn , w@@ ong , same difference .
and darwin kept these cop@@ i@@ ous not@@ e@@ books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun@@ ch .
they &apos;ve been building it so long i don &apos;t remember where it is .
and i &apos;m more of the , &quot; life &apos;s mess@@ y , clean it up , organi@@ ze it and put it into a ben@@ to box . &quot;
they take that information inside , and they decide what tas@@ ks to carry out depen@@ ding on who &apos;s in the min@@ ority and who &apos;s in the majority of any given population .
by doing so , you will join us and coun@@ t@@ less others in what i truly believe is the greatest ad@@ vent@@ ure ever taken , the ever@@ -@@ dem@@ and@@ ing journey of equ@@ ality .
and the reason we see min@@ es is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable ra@@ w materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
so if i do something that hur@@ ts you , i feel that pain .
did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invest@@ ed here in africa ?
and in two hours , after their bac@@ ks were broke , they were changed .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it is always the same , never the same , end@@ less@@ ly fascinating .
the second , i believe , is political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
no , i was quie@@ t . i was quie@@ t because i had not come for truth .
when he met me and realized that it was possible for him to study in a quanti@@ ta@@ tive way how his design choices im@@ pac@@ ted the ec@@ ology and biology of this building , he got really excited , because it ad@@ ded a new dimension to what he did .
the 200@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year period in which men have been top dog is truly coming to an end , believe it or not , and that &apos;s why i talk about the &quot; end of men . &quot;
so they tend to expect the future to be worse than it ends up being .
so in a way , we &apos;re showing a mani@@ fest@@ ation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have .
it is a mobile ph@@ one-@@ sha@@ ped box that has an ir@@ on weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
now the rules that i &apos;m talking about are constantly being monit@@ or@@ ed by the culture .
thinking it through , i realized that all those at@@ tribu@@ tes must be changed to move t to the den@@ om@@ in@@ ator .
and we have a lot of sk@@ ill and experience , but it &apos;s a trick , so how are you supposed to pre@@ p@@ are to get through that glass cei@@ ling ?
serious problems , big problems , pres@@ sing problems .
it happened again about 120 or a 1@@ 40 million years ago when some soli@@ t@@ ary was@@ ps began creating little simple , primi@@ tive ne@@ sts , or hi@@ ves .
this is what we must demand of our lives , of our objects , of our things , of our circum@@ stances : living with in@@ tent .
and it was only at that moment , as we were sitting down to dinner , that i recogni@@ zed the enor@@ m@@ ity of the risk i had created , because to bring these two ti@@ t@@ ans , these two ma@@ sters of the universe together -- it was like intro@@ duc@@ ing mo@@ thr@@ a to go@@ d@@ z@@ ill@@ a over the sky@@ line of to@@ k@@ yo .
and interest@@ ingly , the older i became , and when i became a ful@@ l-@@ time student at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
that &apos;s what business does when it makes a profit .
i &apos;m addi@@ cted , because even though i know i &apos;m losing my gri@@ p on reality , i still cra@@ ve more .
but over the &apos; 7@@ 0s and &apos; 8@@ 0s , the south korea government decided they wanted to rapi@@ dly industri@@ alize , and so what they did was , they started to push women into the work@@ force .
the middle income countries , the emerging economy , they are cat@@ ching up .
you already heard about that . you know what that means .
after he swa@@ m the north pole , le@@ wi@@ s pu@@ gh vo@@ wed never to take another col@@ d-@@ water di@@ p . then he heard of la@@ ke im@@ ja in the hi@@ mal@@ ay@@ as , created by recent gl@@ ac@@ ial mel@@ ting , and la@@ ke pu@@ mor@@ i , a body of water at an al@@ titude of 5@@ 300 m on ever@@ est -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swi@@ mming and think about climate change .
for example , dan p@@ ink &apos;s talk on motivation , which was pretty good if you haven &apos;t seen it : &quot; drop car@@ rot . drop stick . bring meaning . &quot;
and i believe that a group like this can have a very major impact , not just because you can share technology with us , but because so many of you have children .
because , if the board of direc@@ tors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely depen@@ dent on the decisions made by the board of direc@@ tors , it makes the dis@@ par@@ ity in sal@@ aries slightly more justi@@ fi@@ able than if you actually ac@@ knowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tac@@ tical activity .
now , i &apos;ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : what is the evidence in people that eating certain fo@@ ods can reduce angiogen@@ es@@ is in cancer ?
so one of the reasons that i have come here to talk about this today is to -- frank@@ ly , sel@@ fis@@ h@@ ly -- un@@ bur@@ den myself and let it be known that this is not an un@@ trou@@ bled mind that has written all of these books .
and they didn &apos;t kill it . they called us to catch it .
and i of course knew stuff , as a designer , about ty@@ po@@ graph@@ y , even though we worked with those animals not so success@@ fully .
change is happening , and the change that is happening is not one that is in software .
well on september 4@@ th , there was a huge m@@ op@@ -up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
ok , this is mo@@ unt ever@@ est .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve developed several vehi@@ cles -- is what we believe is the world &apos;s first autonom@@ ously dri@@ f@@ ting car .
you don &apos;t work in your self-@@ interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wir@@ ing changes in the way it fun@@ ctions .
but it &apos;s when you put all of these elements together -- when you get the vi@@ ral appe@@ al of a great jo@@ ke with a powerful pun@@ ch@@ line that &apos;s cra@@ f@@ ted from hon@@ est@@ y and integri@@ ty , it can have a real world impact at changing a conversation .
i would be willing to bet that i &apos;m the du@@ m@@ best guy in the room because i couldn &apos;t get through school . i strug@@ gl@@ ed with school .
it will change the perception and opini@@ on of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
this is a cal@@ f in cap@@ tivity making an im@@ it@@ ation if you hum@@ med this tun@@ e to your dog or c@@ at and it hum@@ med it back to you , you ought to be pretty surprised .
the problem is that these pu@@ ps need a stable platform of soli@@ d ice in order to nur@@ se from their mom@@ s .
now , when you are about to say or do something , we can think , do i want this to be part of my leg@@ acy , part of my personal record ?
and so that happened more at various times , but i really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman .
you have a situation where the relationship between government and local social net@@ working companies is creating a situation where , effectively , the em@@ power@@ ing potential of these plat@@ forms is being con@@ stra@@ ined because of these relationships between companies and government .
so if we had to design a perfect co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plant , what we would try to do is target it to be able to allow music trans@@ mission .
we &apos;re here , we &apos;re part of a community , sharing out ideas and discus@@ sing them .
this is when we &apos;re like , &quot; ok , we &apos;re going to be ok , this is actually going to work . &quot;
as you can see from the pictures , both no@@ am and i had an early fascin@@ ation with first principles , and over the years , as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisti@@ cated , this early a@@ we with the bas@@ ics has only intensi@@ fied .
it &apos;s achie@@ vable . we should do it econom@@ ically , we should do it mor@@ ally , and we should do it for quality of life .
well , first there are str@@ ands of magnetic field left inside , but now the super@@ conduc@@ tor doesn &apos;t like them moving around , because their mov@@ ements dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te energy , which brea@@ ks the super@@ conduc@@ tivity state .
i want to look back 20 years from now and see that there &apos;s another li@@ beri@@ an girl , gh@@ an@@ ai@@ an girl , nigeri@@ an girl , ethi@@ op@@ ian girl standing on this ted stage .
as humans , we are social , we are em@@ path@@ ic , and that &apos;s great .
so when i got this email from dr. gei@@ ger , i knew i was supposed to be proud to be part of this history .
it &apos;s more expensive to transport goods . pri@@ ces of goods go up , inf@@ lation is affected .
went on , and eventually decided to de@@ vote myself , full time , to that .
we worked with a lot of companies in brazil that put money into this project , the government .
oh . one thing i want to point out is , look at sti@@ ck@@ y@@ bot .
that &apos;s a great answer . re@@ bec@@ ca sa@@ x@@ e , thank you very much . that was fantastic .
they &apos;ve gone out to do different tas@@ ks , and the rate at which they meet as they come in and out of the nest ent@@ r@@ ance determin@@ es , or influ@@ ences , each ant &apos;s decision about whether to go out , and which task to per@@ form .
and so a ham@@ mer , when we gra@@ b a ham@@ mer , that &apos;s what we &apos;re grab@@ bing .
hum@@ p@@ bac@@ ks , when they develop the ability to sing this song , they &apos;re listening to other wh@@ ales and modi@@ fying what they sing based on what they &apos;re hearing , just like song birds or the dolph@@ in whi@@ st@@ les i described .

now of course , the moment that it does hit the outside environment , and its temperature ris@@ es by even a fra@@ ction of a degree , it immediately turns back into normal matter .
we are limited with di@@ stances right now , but our goal is actually to increase those di@@ stances over time .
the second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more or@@ ph@@ ans .
and i would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
i work for the new yor@@ ker , and i do co@@ vers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and u@@ tter end of the world as we knew it .
when i was vis@@ iting my ter@@ min@@ ally ill father in a hospital , i was asking myself , how does anybody get well in a place that sounds like this ?
and behavi@@ oral design is all about feeling in control , which inclu@@ des us@@ ability , understanding -- but also the feel and he@@ ft .
so probably it doesn &apos;t matter 50 years from now -- stre@@ p@@ to@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us and stuff like that will be ra@@ mp@@ ant -- because we won &apos;t be here . but if we are -- we &apos;re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
except , of course , it wasn &apos;t the she@@ ep &apos;s cle@@ vern@@ ess .
and they said , &quot; we don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just ritu@@ als that give us meaning . &quot;
which brings on another th@@ res@@ hold effect i like to call fur@@ n@@ ace du@@ mp@@ ing , which is , quite simply , if you have a building that doesn &apos;t need to be he@@ ated with a fur@@ n@@ ace , you save a whole bunch of money up front .
the only two requi@@ re@@ ments were that they were studying at the university , and they spoke english .
and second , i don &apos;t care about the word , i care about how you use it .
you start looking at how the global plane fli@@ ghts move , and you suddenly discover that the world isn &apos;t even close to flat .
the position of women , how clo@@ sely they keep to the nuclear family , are on opposite ends of the po@@ les in terms of the rich developed world .
so i realized then that i wanted to go out on a journey and see what guys were creating for themselves now .
but structures designed to connect , rather than divi@@ de mu@@ tu@@ ally depen@@ dent cir@@ cles , rather than isol@@ ating tri@@ an@@ gles .
they used their six words to talk back to me and ask me if i &apos;d been too much on google l@@ ately .
and indeed , at the top , you &apos;ll see before the surgery , the areas in blue are the areas that use less gl@@ u@@ co@@ se than normal , pre@@ domin@@ antly the par@@ ie@@ tal and tem@@ po@@ ral lo@@ bes .
and she walked forward with such cal@@ m and such c@@ lar@@ ity and such total lack of fear that she could walk right up to the first gun , put her hand on it and lower it .
one of them also being , although logi@@ cally it &apos;s quite a good idea to have a li@@ ft with no up and down butt@@ on in it , if it only ser@@ ves two flo@@ ors , it &apos;s actually b@@ loo@@ dy terri@@ fying , okay ?
it has ro@@ cked the music industry ; it has changed the way we consu@@ me music .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wer@@ y poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
top left , we have canada and australia , with enormous land areas , very high per capit@@ a consumption , 200 or 300 light bul@@ bs per person , and very low population den@@ si@@ ties .
do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think they &apos;re too co@@ dd@@ led , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;ve got , we &apos;re going to raise a generation of privi@@ le@@ ged ...
this , all this bad news , is pre@@ vent@@ able .
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the yo@@ unger kids .
but this tells us how we need to think about it , and where we need to go .
because from what i can tell , the three things gay americans seem to want most are to join the military , get married and start a family .
the environments we are living in , more typically , are like these .
and because of that announ@@ c@@ ement , we got a big article in the new york times , which led to more press , which led to more attention , and me deci@@ ding to become ce@@ o of that company -- whereas i was just an ad@@ vis@@ er -- and raising a round of vent@@ ure capital and ra@@ mp@@ ing up hir@@ ing .
but even more stri@@ king than the fer@@ o@@ cious power e@@ man@@ ating from that well was the re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness with which that power was un@@ le@@ as@@ hed -- the car@@ el@@ ess@@ ness , the lack of planning that characteri@@ zed the operation from dri@@ ll@@ ing to cle@@ an-@@ up .
and so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t ta@@ sted the fru@@ it of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of mor@@ ality would we have ?
india , mexico and others are already making experiment@@ al flu vac@@ cin@@ es , and they may be the first place we see these vac@@ cin@@ es in use .
the mira@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
what you see here on this tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess graph is the higher the black do@@ t is on the graph , the higher the tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .

first , it en@@ ables you to experience the universe : the worldwide telescop@@ e , for me , is a kind of magic car@@ pet that lets you navi@@ gate through the universe where you want to go .
i heard about a little girl who couldn &apos;t stop pe@@ eing on her@@ self because so many grown soldiers had sho@@ ved themselves inside her .
i believe the concept of global citi@@ zen@@ ship will simply grow out of people talking to each other across contin@@ ents .
one of the people we intervie@@ wed was frank j@@ ord@@ an , former ma@@ yo@@ r of san francisco . before that he was ch@@ ie@@ f of police in san francisco .
this is probably the sa@@ d@@ dest sound i &apos;ve ever heard coming from any organis@@ m , human or other .
and i promise to you , this was such an important moment in my career , when i realized that the great leader believed in young people and new ideas .
and so every time they found something that looked a little different , they named it something different .
they &apos;re watching all of us . they &apos;ve du@@ g a bas@@ ement , and they &apos;ve built a sp@@ y center to try and run algorith@@ ms and figure out which ones of us are trou@@ bl@@ es@@ ome , and if any of us com@@ pla@@ in about that , we &apos;re ar@@ re@@ sted for terror@@ ism .
we &apos;re also starting an@@ c@@ ill@@ ary heal@@ th-@@ care technology training programs -- training people in e@@ cho@@ car@@ di@@ ograph@@ y , car@@ di@@ a@@ c ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und , those kinds of things . now , with that kind of training , it gives people motivation .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the in@@ her@@ ent sugar tra@@ pped in the star@@ ch .
that &apos;s a picture i took of my bronx bor@@ ough president , add@@ res@@ sing my kids in his house , not the ja@@ il@@ house , making them feel a part of it .
whenever a fly reach@@ es the mid@@ point of the cham@@ ber where the two od@@ or stre@@ ams meet , it has to make a decision .
if you do that tomorrow , i &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
so the first idea i had , ini@@ tially , was just to go the fe@@ der@@ al and state governments and go , &quot; here , take it , for free . &quot;
we are left with this missing space of increas@@ ed dea@@ ths the further north you go .
d@@ um ta da da d@@ um d@@ um ta da da d@@ um well , your musi@@ cian friend will stop you and say , &quot; you know , the theme music for your data revolution , that &apos;s an oper@@ a , that &apos;s wa@@ g@@ ner .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost un@@ accep@@ table to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
now i don &apos;t know why , but it might be because , in their case , their cells haven &apos;t actually figured out the right thing to do with that ex@@ cess energy .
every interaction we have in the world is recor@@ ded by an ever growing ar@@ ray of sensor@@ s : your phone , your credit card , your computer . the result is big data , and it actually pres@@ ents us with an opportunity to more deeply understand the human condition .
you look at the patients , you can dri@@ ll in all the contro@@ ls , you can look at them , you can ask them .

these leaders are trying to for@@ ge a massive national non@@ violent movement to end the occu@@ pa@@ tion and build peace in the region .
i &apos;ve got a little video to show you , but keep in mind that this is with no electr@@ onic control , and this is also with only four le@@ ds .
and when that happens there &apos;s moment that causes this robot to roll .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y skep@@ tic james rand@@ i takes a f@@ at@@ al do@@ se of home@@ op@@ ath@@ ic sle@@ eping p@@ ills on@@ stage , ki@@ cking off a se@@ aring 18@@ -@@ minute indi@@ ct@@ ment of ir@@ rational belie@@ fs . he thro@@ ws out a challenge to the world &apos;s psych@@ ics : prove what you do is real , and i &apos;ll give you a million dollars .
the future states that there is no time other than the collap@@ sation of that sen@@ sation of the mirror of the memor@@ ies in which we are living .
and i remem@@ ber@@ ed that the old and dr@@ un@@ ken guy came one day to the lab wan@@ ting to make some easy c@@ ash and this was the guy .
people with color@@ ed hearing actually see colors when they hear the sounds of words or letters .
and indeed , unfortunately , if you navi@@ gate by needs you get a very un@@ focused agenda , because in these situations , needs are everywhere , but the capacity to imple@@ ment change is very limited .
most of the people who lived here either lived in co@@ ast@@ al villa@@ ges , fishing , or were no@@ ma@@ ds who ro@@ am@@ ed around with the environment trying to find water .
try to imagine a gor@@ ill@@ a per@@ forming the same man@@ eu@@ ver , and you can see that , compared with gor@@ ill@@ a , we are hal@@ f@@ way to being sha@@ ped like a fish .
now as i was training in clinical medicine and he@@ mat@@ ology and on@@ c@@ ology and stem cell transplan@@ tation , what we had instead , cas@@ c@@ ading through the regul@@ atory network at the f@@ da , were these sub@@ stances -- ar@@ sen@@ ic , th@@ ali@@ dom@@ i@@ de and this chemical der@@ i@@ va@@ tive of ni@@ tro@@ gen mu@@ star@@ d gas .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ fl@@ at@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logi@@ cal shape on the inside of a ca@@ ve , fo@@ am@@ e@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ lo@@ cks to deal with this complex to@@ po@@ log@@ y , various ways of getting brea@@ thing g@@ ases made from the in@@ trin@@ si@@ c materials of these bodies .
so the first thing i &apos;d like is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film -- is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right .
he also expla@@ ined to me that i had a brother , too , and the first time i saw them i must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
so it took me from places like chi@@ le -- the at@@ ac@@ ama desert in chi@@ le -- to si@@ ber@@ ia , to under@@ ground min@@ es in the japanese al@@ ps , in northern america , all the way to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a and even to the south pole .
so what we &apos;re trying to do is , we &apos;re trying to push these technologies towards creating bot@@ tom@@ -up construction approach@@ es for architecture , which contr@@ ast the current , vic@@ tor@@ ian , top@@ -@@ down metho@@ ds which im@@ pose structure upon matter .
simil@@ arly , a lot of art projects stay in the art community , and i feel very much a responsibility through mechanis@@ ms like ted , and like our relationship with the obama white house , with the sen@@ ate , with john ker@@ ry , to influence policy as much as possible with these pictures as well .
he said , &quot; as a kid . &quot; he said , &quot; actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fire@@ man . &quot;
so this motiv@@ ated me to become an or@@ th@@ op@@ edi@@ c surge@@ on and to see if i couldn &apos;t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing spor@@ ts and not li@@ mit me .
now if you fall below the average on this cur@@ ve , then psych@@ ologists get thri@@ ll@@ ed , because that means you &apos;re either depres@@ sed or you have a dis@@ order , or hopefully both .
it is , argu@@ ably , the most au@@ d@@ aci@@ ous en@@ dea@@ vor of that ed@@ war@@ di@@ an golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from sc@@ ur@@ vy to solar pan@@ els , that it was high time someone had a go at fin@@ ishing the job .
h@@ c : so , after about a day of chris and i star@@ ing at each other , we came up with something that was pretty close to the ham@@ bur@@ ger pat@@ ty , and as you can see it basically forms like ham@@ bur@@ ger meat .
so we &apos;re starting to pay for things with money that we have .
what turned out to deter@@ mine whether someone would stop and help a stran@@ ger in need was how much of a hur@@ ry they thought they were in -- were they feeling they were late , or were they absor@@ bed in what they were going to talk about .
this isn &apos;t about the biology of people ; this is now about the brains , the psychology of people , and innovation needs to continue all the way through the last mile .
so like fo@@ x mul@@ der on &quot; x-@@ fil@@ es , &quot; who wants to believe in u@@ fo@@ s ? well , we all do , and the reason for that is because we have a belief engine in our brains .
it helped me realize something else during this project , is that recor@@ ding that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult .
the more that robots ing@@ rain themselves into our everyday lives , the more we &apos;re forced to exam@@ ine ourselves as people . at tedx@@ ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , ken gold@@ berg shares four very human lessons that he &apos;s learned from working with robots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i believe a story there has to be told .
fer@@ din@@ and fo@@ ch , a french army general cre@@ di@@ ted with having one of the most original and sub@@ tle minds in the french army , said , &quot; air@@ planes are interesting to@@ ys , but of no military value . &quot;
so it &apos;s pretty sad to find that chimpanze@@ es , like so many other creatures around the world , are losing their habit@@ ats .
it &apos;s about how you approach problems . and there is this huge , beautiful common@@ ality between design , business and the world .
and we view it with a camera system i developed called e@@ ye@@ -@@ in-@@ the-@@ sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive .
so , here are these women . they &apos;ve seen their parents have strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve strug@@ gl@@ ed with di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , they &apos;ve seen lots of dea@@ ths . how do they answer this question ?
i was walking through el dor@@ a@@ do -- it &apos;s a prison town , famous prison , or in@@ famous prison -- in ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , and i don &apos;t know what pos@@ s@@ essed me , because this was not like me .
well we know that that was not a cheap war .
of course i can . and they &apos;d enjoy it im@@ men@@ sely ; i see them standing around right now , everywhere .
you call your friend , she puts her hand@@ set in a robot , and , b@@ am ! you &apos;re a me@@ bot -- you can make eye contact , you can talk with your friends , you can move around , you can gest@@ ure -- maybe the next best thing to really being there , or is it ?
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its ac@@ compan@@ ying image , and how the image is trans@@ formed by the text and the text by the image .
but what i felt towards the child at that moment was deep affe@@ ction , but nothing like what i feel for him now , five years later .
he could not probably give the right kind of love for you , but for us , he has given the people the right kind of love , that is important .
i learned they are the sin@@ e@@ w which hold the force together .
no , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; oh , this must be my mother .
now , when you look at that the first time , you think , &quot; my god . how is reality coming out of that ? &quot;
and yet , despite everything going really well for john , he was strug@@ gling , fighting addi@@ ction and a gri@@ pping depression .
but is there a rational fear that actually , the reason we &apos;re fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed about this is because we think that the big one is to come ?
i didn &apos;t want anyone to know that i was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
but the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with p@@ ure , consi@@ stent no@@ vel@@ ty .
waiting 10 years for the pa@@ yo@@ ff from education is too long when you need to meet daily needs , when you &apos;ve got si@@ bl@@ ings to look after or a business to help with .
and they land on the flo@@ wer . they stick their ton@@ gue in there , called a pro@@ bo@@ sc@@ is , and they drink sugar water .
so a person that &apos;s inter@@ acting with the robot under@@ stands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its mo@@ tions .
the future , as we know it , is very un@@ predic@@ table .
see the bri@@ ck wall as all these problems we &apos;ve in@@ fli@@ cted on the planet , environmental and social . it &apos;s a message of hope .
in may of 2010 , at 35 years old , with a two-@@ year-old at home and my second child on the way , i was diagno@@ sed with a large an@@ eur@@ y@@ s@@ m at the base of my th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic a@@ or@@ ta .
and it sees multiple people in a scene , remem@@ bers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remem@@ ber@@ ing people .
ok , now , allow it to stay there .
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simu@@ late the human body and to simu@@ late that bit of the nervous system of the brain that contro@@ ls that body .
she said she is &quot; sil@@ ly , nice and friend@@ ly . &quot;
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communic@@ ations patterns using a lot of these tools . and dou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attac@@ ks of last week .
creating our own program to solve problems , like fighting corruption , building institutions , stabili@@ zing the mi@@ cr@@ o economy .
yeah , thought so . so we &apos;ve all seen it , haven &apos;t we ?
you &apos;re looking at the outside sh@@ ell of the virus , and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus that are evol@@ ving very , very fast , and the blue parts are not evol@@ ving very fast .
and there &apos;re only 10@@ 2 because people got bor@@ ed colle@@ cting them : there are just new ones every year .
i mean , can you picture a politi@@ cian standing up in britain and saying , &quot; g@@ dp fell two percent this year . good news !
so when the ech@@ o of the g@@ uns@@ h@@ ots had l@@ ing@@ ered , it was soon dro@@ w@@ ned by the chan@@ ting of the mo@@ b , and i didn &apos;t believe what i was hearing .
now i &apos;m not a law@@ yer , but if i would be , this is where i would say , &quot; i rest my case . &quot;
for those who probably know , if you don &apos;t have any sensor@@ s and there are any dist@@ urban@@ ces , you know what happens .
these are the people who are doing the bul@@ k of the site , and they are , in a sense , se@@ mi@@ -@@ profession@@ als at what they &apos;re doing , that the standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality .
she has a cab@@ in@@ et , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
for them , nations , countries , boundar@@ ies , bor@@ ders still matter a great deal , and often viol@@ ently .
it &apos;s just un@@ belie@@ vable what the potential is to take advantage of solar energy there , and i &apos;m really excited to talk more about finding ways we can help with that .
round about that design period leading up to this building , i did a sk@@ et@@ ch , which we pulled out of the archi@@ ve recently .
thank you so mu@@ ch@@ .@@ as : well , thank you . thank you . thank you , chris .
when they &apos;re monit@@ or@@ ing your cli@@ ck@@ stream -- and you know they are -- they have a really hard time fig@@ uring out your age , your gender and your income .
people who need a voice should know that most computers already come with buil@@ t-@@ in speaking systems .
and analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite ted speak@@ ers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glas@@ ses and be slightly more d@@ res@@ se@@ d-@@ up than the average ted speak@@ er .
so -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s mis@@ er@@ able because , you know , we &apos;re from russi@@ a .
but the gene that regul@@ ates that down is broken .
i said , &quot; no , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s pengu@@ in sh@@ it . &quot;
in fact , a friend of mine from the security industry told me the other day that there are two types of companies in the world : those that know they &apos;ve been ha@@ cked , and those that don &apos;t .
and when there were com@@ pla@@ in@@ ts about budget , i said , &quot; well , it &apos;s worth doing the island because you get twice for your money : refle@@ ctions . &quot;
and so we spent time travel@@ ing with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were pl@@ ent@@ y of in@@ effici@@ en@@ cies that weren &apos;t being capit@@ alized on .
and if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
and finally , i hope you agree with me to change that last to@@ dd@@ ler rule just a little bit to : &quot; if it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
why not ? it is possible . look around in this room -- all this knowledge , energy , talent and technology .
one of the more tou@@ ch@@ y political subje@@ cts in b@@ hu@@ tan is the use of indian cheap labor that they im@@ port from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
i need to understand the mass of the object i &apos;m cla@@ im@@ ing is a black hole , and what its schwarz@@ schil@@ d radi@@ us is .
september 10 is not your birthday . it &apos;s oc@@ tober 10 . &quot; and i said , &quot; what ? &quot;
so , some societies , for sub@@ tle environmental reasons , are more fra@@ gi@@ le than others . and then finally , another gener@@ alization . i &apos;m now teaching a course at u@@ cl@@ a , to u@@ cl@@ a under@@ gradu@@ ates , on these collap@@ ses of societies . what really bu@@ gs my u@@ cl@@ a under@@ graduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ?
because such a mechan@@ ism has been found by co@@ sm@@ ologists trying to understand the big bang .

now i thought , you know , if we just did good science , that would change medical practice . but , that was a little nai@@ ve .
and that question is this : when we look around the world , as scientists have done for the last hundred years , there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe .
this one , a little sk@@ et@@ ch@@ y going back@@ wards , and watch the back foot , watch the back foot .
things where you might trip across things like the c@@ oper@@ ni@@ can principle , the fer@@ m@@ i parado@@ x , the anthro@@ pi@@ c principle , the orig@@ in of life .
but if something is written on the s@@ late , then some people could have more of it than others , and according to this line of thinking , that would justi@@ fy dis@@ crimin@@ ation and ine@@ quality .
and i think in the next five or 10 years , we &apos;ll make the kind of squ@@ ar@@ es that i described and maybe even get to some of those self-@@ assem@@ bled circu@@ its .

this is fu@@ el@@ ing a massive shift from where us@@ age tr@@ um@@ ps pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons -- or as kev@@ in kel@@ ly , the edi@@ tor of wired magazine , puts it , &quot; where access is better than ow@@ ner@@ ship . &quot;
this is a device that not only meas@@ ures car@@ di@@ a@@ c rhyth@@ m , as you saw already , but it also goes well beyond that .

in short , they are ac@@ qu@@ ir@@ ing the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
by the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invi@@ te you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
in a world of too many op@@ tions and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignor@@ e the ordinary stuff . marketing gur@@ u se@@ th go@@ d@@ in sp@@ ells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizar@@ re ideas are more successful than bor@@ ing ones .
but the way we re@@ act to different combin@@ ations of these phenomen@@ a is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
there are rich le@@ sters , poor le@@ sters , black le@@ sters , white le@@ sters , not many women le@@ sters , but put that to the side for one second .
we need an exercise . we need a frame@@ work to learn how to be more min@@ d@@ ful .
and if they do so , then , of course , the conditions improve , and they start ri@@ ding on s@@ co@@ ot@@ ers .
germany , my own country , in the year 2000 , fe@@ at@@ u@@ red in the lower quad@@ rant , below average performance , large social dis@@ par@@ i@@ ties .
sorry , it doesn &apos;t work . you have to give it for 100 dollars , 200 dollars .
we also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
and he rema@@ ined there until 1.@@ 6 million years later , when this very famous fossil h@@ unter , kam@@ o@@ ya ki@@ me@@ u , walked along a small h@@ ill@@ side and found that small piece of his sk@@ ul@@ l lying on the surface am@@ on@@ gst the pe@@ b@@ bles , recogni@@ zed it as being hom@@ in@@ id .
it &apos;s been eight years , and i can tell you that i didn &apos;t go to china to become a law@@ yer .
but we do have the potential to over@@ come disease and poverty , and i &apos;m going to talk about those issues , if we have the will .
you &apos;d need millions and millions of teachers in china , india , nigeria and the rest of developing world to meet need .
he knows one world , and he &apos;s finding a way to communicate it to another world , both of which he has deep connections to .
interest@@ ingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
they ac@@ qui@@ re the sensi@@ bility of truth because they repe@@ at over and over again , and they o@@ ssi@@ fy and cal@@ ci@@ fy , and they become real .
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with john@@ son &amp; amp ; john@@ son , to run an i@@ bot , because the best bat@@ ter@@ ies you could get -- 10 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in lead , 20 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m ni@@ ck@@ el@@ -@@ c@@ ad@@ mi@@ um , 40 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in ni@@ ck@@ el@@ -@@ metal hy@@ dri@@ de , 60 wat@@ t-@@ hours per kil@@ ogra@@ m in li@@ thi@@ um , 8@@ ,@@ 7@@ 50 wat@@ t-@@ hours of energy in every kil@@ ogra@@ m of pro@@ pan@@ e or gas@@ ol@@ ine -- which is why nobody dri@@ ves electric cars .
i &apos;ll find a way to get in , because i don &apos;t want to see this history disappe@@ ar . &quot;
so , we thought we would explo@@ it this idea in order to study whether we could predict phenomen@@ a within networks .
the first is , it &apos;s essential for us to understand the human brain if we do want to get along in society , and i think that it is a key step in evolution .
i thought it was all graphi@@ cs -- so here it is in rever@@ se .
and i think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of part@@ ners .
and if you look north here , there &apos;s a big river that flo@@ ws into the la@@ ke that &apos;s been carrying se@@ di@@ ment and preser@@ ving the rema@@ ins of the animals that lived there .
if we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
&quot; ha , i &apos;m the only person i ever loved . &quot;
i &apos;d like to go back and share it with the government of ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i , who are over in tar@@ a@@ wa , the west@@ ern@@ most group .
those cold , hard w@@ inter@@ s , i love it .
oh , after you stopped paying .
and i started across the hall in north car@@ ol@@ ina , because i thought it was probably a can@@ al@@ et@@ to , and would have all that in detail .
so military technologies can influence the course of the world , can make or break world peace -- and there lies the issue with cy@@ ber weapons .
everybody was really excited about curi@@ osity , and that had this big plu@@ ton@@ ium battery on board that has plu@@ ton@@ i@@ um@@ -@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-@@ en@@ rich@@ ed ur@@ ani@@ um fuel of these mol@@ ten s@@ alt re@@ ac@@ tors , which means that the effects would be ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble , because you laun@@ ch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activ@@ ate this re@@ actor .
so it &apos;s very much like in a hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , suppor@@ ted by wir@@ es , and then they take the wir@@ es away digit@@ ally so you &apos;re flying through the air .
with stre@@ ams and ri@@ vers dr@@ ying up because of over@@ -@@ us@@ age , ro@@ b har@@ mon has imple@@ mented an in@@ geni@@ ous market mechan@@ ism to bring back the water . farmers and be@@ er companies find their f@@ ates inter@@ t@@ win@@ ed in the intri@@ gu@@ ing cent@@ ur@@ y-@@ old tale of pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of n@@ ollywood , i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these pre@@ conc@@ ei@@ ved no@@ tions .
so i thought that it will be good to start with it .
and â â the nur@@ se kind of had a hy@@ ster@@ ical lau@@ gh , and i &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flo@@ od vic@@ ti@@ ms of banglades@@ h , and then i look over and my an@@ es@@ thes@@ i@@ ologist is cl@@ am@@ ping the mas@@ k on me , and i think , &quot; he looks banglades@@ hi , &quot; â â and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &quot; this could work somehow . &quot;
in this case , because the experiment i &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are mon@@ et prin@@ ts .
she came down , saw that ma@@ d@@ house and said , &quot; you know what , it &apos;s terrible what you &apos;re doing to those boys .
not just because it ran@@ g earlier , but i &apos;m going to take it because i made a little calcu@@ lation .
kat@@ r@@ ina showed us that we cannot completely dep@@ end on government to have read@@ iness in hand , to be capable of hand@@ ling things .
but i thought , no , no , experiment with res@@ ins , experiment with poly@@ mers .
100 bucks . that &apos;s the pri@@ ce-@@ impro@@ vement cur@@ ve that -- we need some break@@ through@@ s in physics along the way , i &apos;ll gr@@ ant you that .
and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer , obser@@ ving every kilometer a particular object of desire , and then plac@@ ing that within this .
&quot; you &apos;ve never really been sure of this , but i can as@@ sure you that this qu@@ ir@@ k you &apos;re so self-@@ conscious of is inten@@ sely en@@ de@@ aring .
so partic@@ le mas@@ ses , the streng@@ ths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determin@@ ed by the shape of the extra dimensions .
i tried to get it out of anybody i could , you know , &quot; who am i running against here ? &quot;
so this means that , with each eur@@ o he invest@@ ed , he was able to move 26 euro@@ s of market value through the chain of ow@@ ner@@ ship rela@@ tions .
but this one is -- the bi@@ ble says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a men@@ stru@@ ating woman has sat .
and even away from the po@@ dium , when you called him to say hell@@ o , he would often end the conversation pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
but also , if there is something that we cannot reach because it is too high on a cli@@ ff , we have a little las@@ er system which will actually za@@ p the rock , ev@@ apo@@ rate some of it , and actually analy@@ ze what &apos;s coming from that rock .
in germany , we have a system where you are not allowed to bri@@ be a civil ser@@ v@@ ant , but you are allowed to bri@@ be a de@@ pu@@ ty .
thank you , thank you .
all those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thi@@ ck , just a gigan@@ tic dom@@ e that comes in from the coast and ris@@ es in the middle .
and the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging econom@@ ies , we call them .
within a couple of years , every country that started polio er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation rapi@@ dly er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated all three of their polio viruses , with the ex@@ ception of four countries that you see here .
the reason i show this -- not to put a dow@@ ner on everything -- but i just want to use it to key off my philosoph@@ y of life in general , which is that we all have two goals .
now this is a -- it &apos;s a little test i encoura@@ ge you to try out at a party .
due to some sli@@ p-@@ u@@ ps , he managed to es@@ cape d@@ ressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our const@@ it@@ ution , those in office as gover@@ nor@@ s , president -- as in many countries -- have imm@@ unity and cannot be pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted . but what happened : people were so ou@@ tra@@ ged by this behavior that it was possible for his state leg@@ is@@ l@@ ature to im@@ pe@@ ach him and get him out of office .
and when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
specifically , it tar@@ gets japan and korea and australia , countries that are strong al@@ lies of the united states .
and i realized that i had hit upon something that i think has this huge potential to change the world .
that &apos;s actually the actual prin@@ ter right now , and that &apos;s been prin@@ ting this kid@@ ney structure that you see here .
so it &apos;s really interesting , and it makes sense in a way , that they &apos;re still young , so why would they be getting diseases of aging until their old ?
if the l@@ h@@ c fin@@ ds new particles , but they don &apos;t fit this pattern -- well , that will be very interesting , but bad for this e@@ 8 theory .
all right , next .
i can master sho@@ ck of &quot; the cr@@ ying game &quot; with the a@@ we of a child being called an aids vic@@ tim by a bul@@ ly who didn &apos;t know that it was his father who gave it to my mother , and that &apos;s a double ent@@ end@@ re .
and so you &apos;d have this wonderful spar@@ kl@@ ing thing , with the dis@@ k slowly ro@@ tat@@ ing , and this is roughly what it would look like . and so really , part of this is about bringing the beauty of this , of the natural world , to somebody in a very imag@@ in@@ ative way , so that they can start c@@ ali@@ br@@ ating their instin@@ ct across these vast sc@@ ales of space and time .
now this is the way things are going to move , because china has a very specific problem , which is different from europe and different from the united states : china has huge numbers of people and no space .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing . so wikipedia -- you just saw the little demon@@ stration of it -- it &apos;s a fre@@ ely licen@@ sed en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia . it &apos;s written by thousands of volunte@@ ers all over the world in many , many languages .
it had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke english , no one could read or write english .
then , after a few weeks , we set up cam@@ ps .
and remember this picture , because i &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
it &apos;s about an 8@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long tube of metal , it &apos;s got a hundred or so holes on top , on that side is the speak@@ er , and here is some lab tu@@ bing , and it &apos;s connected to this t@@ ank of pro@@ pan@@ e .
right now , as bill mc@@ don@@ ough has poin@@ ted out , the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences .
in a region famous for the soft , por@@ ous lo@@ ess plat@@ e@@ au soil , there lived until recently an esti@@ ma@@ ted 40 million people in these houses under@@ ground .
now i know that seems lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous .
and however we define athei@@ s@@ m , it &apos;s sur@@ ely the kind of acade@@ mic belief that a person is enti@@ t@@ led to hold without being vili@@ fied as an un@@ patri@@ o@@ tic , un@@ elec@@ table non-@@ citi@@ zen .
science has taught us , against all intuition , that appar@@ ently soli@@ d things , like cr@@ y@@ st@@ als and ro@@ cks , are really almost entirely com@@ posed of empty space .
he said , &quot; if the one tri@@ be inclu@@ ded a great number of coura@@ ge@@ ous , sym@@ pa@@ thetic and fa@@ i@@ th@@ ful members who are always ready to aid and de@@ f@@ end each other , this tri@@ be would succe@@ ed better and con@@ qu@@ er the other . &quot;
having expla@@ ined those , that will set up for what i think will be a different idea about how to go about tre@@ ating cancer .
and hopefully we can show the audience now how it is you do what you do .
but you &apos;ve got to ask yourself in the mean@@ time : who do you want on your side of the meeting , someone who &apos;s trained in getting to the truth or some guy who &apos;s going to dra@@ g a 40@@ 0-@@ po@@ und electro@@ en@@ cep@@ hal@@ ogra@@ m through the door ?
the reason , i think , is that the pen@@ sion@@ ers believe they &apos;ve cho@@ sen to be pen@@ sion@@ ers , whereas the young un@@ emplo@@ yed feel it &apos;s been thr@@ ust upon them .
entrop@@ y means that everything in the world , everything , is in a state of dec@@ line and deca@@ y , the ar@@ ch .
we love challenges , but when expec@@ tations are low , trust me , we will sin@@ k to them .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-@@ d@@ ressed .
and this is a mo@@ ck@@ up that is in s@@ alt la@@ ke city that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in ful@@ l-@@ scale .
and so before we could start ima@@ ging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
i don &apos;t see anybody for the whole time that i &apos;m at sea , generally .
and frank@@ ie says , &quot; i &apos;m number 22 in line , and i can see the need@@ le coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
in z@@ im@@ bab@@ we , for example , there were just about a do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , most of whom lived and worked in har@@ are city , leaving only a couple to address the mental health care needs of nine million people living in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and in those univer@@ ses that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form .
children res@@ cu@@ ed from sla@@ very in the fishing industry in ghana , re@@ united with their parents , and then taken with their parents back to their villa@@ ges to re@@ build their economic well-@@ being so that they become sla@@ ve-@@ pro@@ of -- absolutely un@@ en@@ sla@@ ve@@ able .
so as i &apos;m watching this , i see this powerful scene that brought me to te@@ ars , and it stuck with me for the past 25 years .
more than how a phenomenon works , theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts are always interested in why a phenomenon works in the way it works .
we have colle@@ cted and conser@@ ved a great deal of biological diversity , agri@@ cultural diversity , mostly in the form of se@@ ed , and we put it in se@@ ed ban@@ ks , which is a fan@@ cy way of saying a free@@ zer .
so let me put them all together . and also , i can change the sounds by ste@@ pping on this pe@@ d@@ al right here , and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little ham@@ bone sol@@ o or something like this .
if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we b@@ low ourselves up , then the figure becomes astronom@@ ical .
and suddenly , without reali@@ zing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opini@@ ons ; everyone &apos;s got an opini@@ on .
what this means is it &apos;s no longer good enough to say that international rela@@ tions , or global aff@@ air@@ s , or chaos in som@@ alia , or what &apos;s going on in bur@@ ma is none of your business , and that you can leave it to governments to get on with .
i &apos;ll show you a computer model made by i@@ a@@ in cou@@ zin , a resear@@ cher at oxford , that shows how s@@ war@@ ms work .
so david , in that story , is supposed to be the under@@ dog , right ?
but , yeah .
and unfortunately , as you get into that , people get conf@@ used and think , well maybe you think that &apos;s okay .
and she says , &quot; they want to go . &quot; and i said , &quot; hon@@ ey , no they don &apos;t want to go . this is the middle pas@@ sage .
but i also learned very soon there@@ after that jes@@ us also said , and i &apos;m par@@ ap@@ hr@@ asing , the poor would always be with us .
but one question you might want to ask is , are we seeing a ra@@ pid evolution of the brain and of how we process data ?
speaking at the 2007 e@@ g conference , train@@ er ian dun@@ bar as@@ ks us to see the world through the eyes of our belo@@ ved dogs . by knowing our pe@@ ts &apos; perspective , we can build their love and trust . it &apos;s a message that res@@ on@@ ates well beyond the animal world .
what that suggests is that , even in the case of hearing loss , the capacity for music rema@@ ins .
you &apos;re familiar with these cells because they are the ones that fru@@ strate you when you try to s@@ w@@ at the fly .
and i like to explore all the possibilities in the hope that you &apos;ll be on the wa@@ vel@@ ength of your audience .
the other part@@ ners that we have got is business communities .
whether you &apos;re an artist , a technolog@@ ist , a law@@ yer or a fan , the hand@@ ling of copy@@ right directly im@@ pac@@ ts your life .
and you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but i hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
there is a side that fi@@ ghts , and there is a side that kee@@ ps the schools and the fac@@ tor@@ ies and the hospitals open .
your great@@ -@@ great grand@@ parents got by on muscle power , and yet we all think there &apos;s this huge power that &apos;s essential for our lifest@@ yle . and with all the wonderful technology we have we can do things that are much more efficient : conser@@ ve , recy@@ cle , etc .
you &apos;re afraid if you look for your passion and don &apos;t find it , you &apos;ll feel like you &apos;re an i@@ di@@ ot , so then you make exc@@ uses about why you &apos;re not going to look for your passion .
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s under@@ ground .
and she said things that really sho@@ cked me about her vagina -- that it was d@@ rie@@ d-@@ up and finished and dead -- and i was kind of sho@@ cked .
no time . it says i have two minutes left , so we can &apos;t do this .
i &apos;d been travel@@ ing in japan without an agenda other than to photograph , and then i heard about this tree that is 2,@@ 1@@ 80 years old and knew that i had to go visit it .
take out those who say they save too little .
but then we had a meeting with a chinese busin@@ ess@@ man who saw our design and said , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the chinese character for the word &apos; people . &apos; &quot; so , appar@@ ently this is how you write &quot; people , &quot; as in the people &apos;s re@@ public of china .
the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an people , and many other arab@@ s who &apos;ve revol@@ ted and are in transition , have very high expec@@ tations of the government .
and for me china -- i started photograph@@ ing it four years ago , and china truly is a question of sustain@@ ability in my mind , not to mention that china , as well , has a great effect on the industri@@ es that i grew up around .
she said , when she was just about to walk on stage , the tel@@ e-@@ direc@@ tors were still trying to agree on what to do , and so she just walked on stage and did what felt most natural .
it requi@@ red that it was completely tri@@ vi@@ al : that it takes 30 seconds to reser@@ ve a car , go get it , drive it .
you can le@@ an back , but the camera will change its perspective depen@@ ding on which way you &apos;re looking .
what dr. sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those trans@@ form@@ ers using this technology , which is not dis@@ similar from the way an oper@@ a sing@@ er sh@@ at@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and in this , to@@ w@@ ns begin to re@@ think how they organi@@ ze the urban landscape , so that people are encoura@@ ged to slow down and smell the ro@@ ses and connect with one another .
we are gr@@ ate@@ ful , but we know that we can take charge of our own dest@@ in@@ ies if we have the will to re@@ form .
but not wor@@ rying about r@@ ent allowed me to spend my time doing what i love .
and then i went on to refle@@ ct , &quot; isn &apos;t it amazing , this entire dat@@ ab@@ ase , all these recor@@ dings , i &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your sister &quot; -- who arrived two years later -- &quot; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-@@ experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &quot;
so what you want to do is compare the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ head with the average number of to@@ s@@ ses until we first see head@@ -@@ ta@@ il@@ -@@ tail .
look at all the argu@@ ments we have these days over health care , over bon@@ uses and ba@@ il@@ ou@@ ts on wall street , over the gap between rich and poor , over aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive action and sam@@ e-@@ sex marriage .
it &apos;s propor@@ tion@@ ally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it &apos;s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive fun@@ ctions , things like decisi@@ on-@@ making , planning , planning what you &apos;re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ing in@@ appropriate behavior , so stopp@@ ing yourself saying something really ru@@ de or doing something really stupid .
the sen@@ sor would have to be in@@ expensive , ra@@ pid , simple , sensitive , sel@@ ec@@ tive , and minim@@ ally invasi@@ ve .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of whe@@ at , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 st@@ ages .
so , think of the three sett@@ ings i &apos;ve talked to you about : factory , migra@@ tion , office .
and so i realized it was o@@ .@@ k. to go .
and then there &apos;s a part of the universe we can &apos;t see because it &apos;s so den@@ se and so hot , light can &apos;t es@@ cape .
right now , here we are lin@@ ked up to long beach and everywhere else , and all these secret lo@@ cations for a fra@@ ction of that cost , and we can send and recei@@ ve huge quanti@@ ties of information without it co@@ sting anything .
we here inside the room , i believe that we have the same conc@@ ern , and the model that we created in brazil , we can transp@@ l@@ ant it here .
these three systems are coming together , allo@@ wing people to share resources without sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ cing their lifest@@ y@@ les , or their cher@@ ished personal free@@ dom@@ s .
it de@@ teri@@ or@@ ates so quickly in the tro@@ pic@@ s that we &apos;ve had to put this special v@@ acc@@ ine monit@@ or on every single vi@@ al so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s ex@@ posed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good v@@ acc@@ ine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not po@@ tent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
so i &apos;m going to take as inspiration the fact that we &apos;re all interested in inter@@ acting with other people , i &apos;m going to completely stri@@ p it of all its complic@@ ating fe@@ atures , and i &apos;m going to turn that object , that simpli@@ fied object , into a scientific probe , and provide the early st@@ ages , em@@ br@@ y@@ onic st@@ ages of new insi@@ ghts into what happens in two brains while they simul@@ tane@@ ously interact .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
we need to know why people are doing what they &apos;re doing .
equipment that &apos;s ob@@ so@@ le@@ te , equipment that doesn &apos;t quite work , or it works and you can &apos;t fix it . and there &apos;s nothing wrong with that , so long as we use it and we move on .
first of all , was that dance , even though it hadn &apos;t been off@@ ered to her , was her life .
i needed something to go that extra mile , and i found it in that metaphor which i had learned from my mother when i was four .
we need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
they &apos;re smaller , even less rever@@ ber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ l@@ ly music that &apos;s very intri@@ cate -- and it works .
in the spec@@ tac@@ ular lar@@ ge-@@ scale projects he &apos;s famous for , ol@@ af@@ ur eli@@ as@@ son creates art from a pal@@ ette of space , distance , color and light . this ide@@ a-@@ pac@@ ked talk begins with an experiment in the nature of perception .
my friend r@@ on@@ ald got@@ tes@@ man says there are three kinds of people in the world : those who can count , and those who can &apos;t .
and he had a very large head , which she thought might indi@@ cate hydro@@ cep@@ hal@@ us .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 0@@ 0s , early 19@@ 0@@ 0s , all of a sudden , the bar@@ ber surge@@ on had given way to the physi@@ cian who was trying to make a diagno@@ sis .
but , u@@ h-@@ oh , the kill@@ ers are within the cam@@ ps .
the future entertain@@ ment media that we &apos;re going to see is going to be very dat@@ a-@@ driven , and it &apos;s going to be based on the information that we as@@ certain from taste communities online , where women are really driving the action .
and she saw that if there is no in@@ fl@@ am@@ ma@@ tion then the scan is a uni@@ form gra@@ y .
some people think this number &apos;s a little bit large , but copy@@ right mathemati@@ cians who are media lo@@ bby experts are mer@@ ely surprised that it doesn &apos;t get com@@ po@@ unded for inf@@ lation every year .
invest , invest , invest . &quot;
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a prin@@ ter , a color prin@@ ter , it prin@@ ts colors . that &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do .
so , two months later , i went into ti@@ bet , and i started intervie@@ wing the people there , taking my photographs . that &apos;s what i do .
if you &apos;ve ever seen an electr@@ on microscop@@ e picture , you &apos;ll see this . this all looks the same , then there &apos;s this bit over here which is incredibly complicated .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to r@@ attle .
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two sta@@ ge@@ hands all in black with wat@@ ering cans ran along the top and started to po@@ ur water on the sand ca@@ st@@ le , and the sand ca@@ st@@ le started to dri@@ p and sin@@ k , but before it did , the audience saw the black@@ -@@ cla@@ d sta@@ ge@@ hands .
but the really interesting thing about it is that , a few years ago , cen@@ su@@ s scientists discovered that this guy can thri@@ ve in oxy@@ gen@@ -@@ poor se@@ di@@ ments in the deep medi@@ ter@@ ran@@ e@@ an sea .
and he has decided to treat them as if they were tri@@ lo@@ bit@@ es , or sna@@ ils , and to do a mor@@ ph@@ ological analysis , and try to der@@ i@@ ve their gene@@ alo@@ gical history over time .
all i have to do is hum@@ bly follow .
so the problem that we face with this is that , throughout the landscape , all these po@@ ols of water with the lar@@ va@@ e , they are sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed all over the place , which makes it very hard for an in@@ spec@@ tor like this to actually find all these bre@@ eding sites and treat them with inse@@ c@@ ti@@ ci@@ des .
electr@@ on@@ ics k@@ its are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts in@@ her@@ ent in their design influence the way we learn .
collective learning is a very , very powerful force , and it &apos;s not clear that we humans are in charge of it .
and so one of the tools that we can use to sam@@ ple the oceans is ac@@ ou@@ stics , or sound waves .
and if you play that well , you &apos;ll have other people involved , so even that game exten@@ ds and continu@@ es even when you &apos;re gone .
the po@@ em that &apos;s coming up is based on him trying to tell me a little something about a dom@@ esti@@ c point of e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette in country living that i had a very hard time , at first , process@@ ing .
i think philosop@@ hi@@ cally , that was one of the most important pa@@ pers that we &apos;ve ever done because it showed how dynamic life was .
gas , i &apos;m probably the only person who really enjo@@ ys it when mi@@ ster pu@@ tin turns off the gas ta@@ p , because my budget goes up .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front des@@ k and the guy at the front des@@ k said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor ton@@ ight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
he was bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ d@@ y-@@ like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a re@@ alist mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ading as an ide@@ alist or an ide@@ alist mas@@ qu@@ er@@ ading as a re@@ alist , as people always wonder@@ ed about bo@@ bby ken@@ ne@@ dy and john ken@@ ne@@ dy in that way .
and if anybody as@@ ks why you &apos;re carrying a con@@ dom , you can just say you like the design .
the more surprising thing was that when we collabor@@ ated with econom@@ ists to actually look at the mon@@ keys &apos; data using economic tools , they basically mat@@ ched , not just qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively , but quanti@@ ta@@ tively with what we saw humans doing in a real market .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
but are we to assu@@ me that the same brilli@@ ance and creativity and adap@@ t@@ ability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow myster@@ i@@ ously going to ev@@ apo@@ rate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
and the number of us who live outside the old nation@@ -@@ state categ@@ ories is increasing so quickly , by 6@@ 4 million just in the last 12 years , that soon there will be more of us than there are americans .
okay , see ? it &apos;s done . it &apos;s almost done . here we go .
what you see here in black line is the safe operating space , the quanti@@ fied boundar@@ ies , as suggest@@ ed by this analysis .
but what was interesting was , the paki@@ stan@@ i musli@@ m guy -- see he gives a bad name to musli@@ ms and middle e@@ ast@@ ern@@ ers and paki@@ stan@@ is from all over the world .
so a couple of things i &apos;ve created are , there &apos;s a poster over here that you can play dru@@ ms on .
and you might think it &apos;s just good kar@@ ma to see these guys stir@@ ring sh@@ it , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
it bur@@ ned kind of slow , but it made a nice smell , compared to other ro@@ cket fu@@ els i had tried , that all had su@@ l@@ fu@@ r in them .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
i must say that before i went to the u.s. i didn &apos;t consci@@ ously identify as african .
and this man , arch@@ ie co@@ ch@@ ran@@ e , is a pris@@ on@@ er of war and a doctor , and he has a problem .
biolog@@ ist mark pa@@ gel shares an intri@@ gu@@ ing theory about why humans evolved our complex system of language . he suggests that language is a piece of &quot; social technology &quot; that allowed early human tri@@ bes to access a powerful new tool : co@@ operation .
and the fire that bur@@ ned in me on day three through six of chem@@ o is the fire that is burning in the fore@@ sts of the world .
and i only st@@ um@@ bled on this because i was living in mal@@ Ã© , in mal@@ di@@ ves for long enough for it to per@@ col@@ ate into my brain that something rather special was going on .
ba@@ o y@@ on@@ g@@ xi@@ u : &quot; my mother tells me to come home and get married , but if i mar@@ ry now , before i have fully developed myself , i can only mar@@ ry an ordinary wor@@ ker , so i &apos;m not in a rus@@ h . &quot;
imagine a country with ab@@ und@@ ant power -- oil and gas , s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine , wind -- but missing one key essential for life : water . infrastructure engineer fa@@ had al-@@ at@@ ti@@ ya talks about the un@@ expected ways that the small middle eastern nation of q@@ at@@ ar creates its water supply .
that &apos;s what happened to me when i noticed that we are moving from passi@@ ve consum@@ ers to cre@@ ators , to highly en@@ ab@@ led collabor@@ ators .
that means that the exchange will operate a tra@@ ding system , which will ini@@ tially start as an open out@@ c@@ ry , because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electr@@ onic tra@@ ding .
this means that a lot of people are just left completely dis@@ satis@@ fied and incre@@ dul@@ ous when i attemp@@ t to explain consciousness .
when i go to a philosop@@ her &apos;s party and they ask me what i work on and i say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t gla@@ ze over -- their li@@ ps cur@@ l into a s@@ nar@@ l .
i think po@@ p@@ cor@@ n could change the way that we tell stories on the web , and the way we understand the world we live in .
and i do believe that this interaction with the history , with history that is often very difficult , to gra@@ pp@@ le with it , to create a position that is beyond our normal expec@@ tations and to create a cri@@ ti@@ que .
now , syl@@ via &apos;s ted prize wish was to bes@@ ee@@ ch us to do anything we could , everything we could , to set asi@@ de not p@@ in pri@@ cks , but significant exp@@ ans@@ es of the ocean for preser@@ vation , &quot; hope spo@@ ts , &quot; she calls them .
the water -- water is perhaps one of the most cru@@ cial issues that we &apos;re going to face in this century -- and everywhere water is being pollu@@ ted by agri@@ cultural , industrial and hou@@ se@@ hold chemicals that still are being spra@@ yed around the world , seem@@ ingly with the in@@ ability to profit from past experience .
&quot; the human voice : myster@@ i@@ ous , spon@@ tane@@ ous , pri@@ mal . &quot; with these words , sop@@ ran@@ o c@@ lar@@ on mc@@ fa@@ dden invi@@ tes us to explore the myster@@ ies of brea@@ thing and sing@@ ing , as she per@@ forms the challen@@ ging &quot; ari@@ a , &quot; by john c@@ age . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
and so we have this pengu@@ in project . the wild@@ life conser@@ vation society has fund@@ ed me along with a lot of individuals over the last 27 years to be able to produce these kinds of maps .
the opportunity we &apos;re going to look to is a genu@@ ine basis for optimis@@ m about the bottom billion , and that is the com@@ modi@@ ty bo@@ oms .
so i wrote a book about this in &apos; 9@@ 3 , but as i was fin@@ ishing the book , i had to do a little bit of typ@@ es@@ et@@ ting , and i was ti@@ red of going to my local copy shop to do it , so i bought a computer .
and , in fact , the first pi@@ one@@ ering treat@@ ments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
and to do that meant creating the fl@@ at@@ test gra@@ di@@ ents that had ever yet been made , which meant building long vi@@ a@@ du@@ cts across river val@@ le@@ ys -- this is actually the vi@@ a@@ du@@ ct across the th@@ ames at ma@@ iden@@ head -- and long tun@@ n@@ els such as the one at box , in wil@@ ts@@ hi@@ re .
we know that &apos;s wrong , because we condu@@ cted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geogra@@ ph@@ y ma@@ tter@@ ed more than institutions .
all right . mi@@ ke , thanks so much .
the costs have been tremendous -- water pollution , all the things you know about , destruction of our habit@@ ats .
and on one particular day , the cam@@ pers were jum@@ ping through inner tu@@ bes , they were di@@ ving through inner tu@@ bes . and i thought this would be great fun .
and this isn &apos;t just a sort of shor@@ t-@@ term work@@ force to connect patients to basic resources , it &apos;s a next generation healthcare leadership pi@@ p@@ eline who &apos;ve spent two , three , four years in the clin@@ ic waiting room talking to patients about their most basic health needs .
we think do@@ od@@ ling is something you do when you lose focus , but in reality , it is a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure to stop you from losing focus .
the detail that you can get today is quite amazing .
so again , what we focus on is pre@@ ven@@ tion rather than treatment , at first rate .
you know that when you have those ab@@ u@@ sive voices , all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real tox@@ ic &quot; i want to kill myself &quot; kind of chemical , and if you have that over and over again on a loo@@ p ta@@ pe , you might have yourself depression .
next . and this is something deeper , and this is where i &apos;m â i think i was on tour when i , i was reading one of the fe@@ yn@@ man bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ es . it was the red one or the blue one .
we &apos;re interested in finding beauty that &apos;s more than just an a@@ es@@ thetic ; it &apos;s really a truth .
you see , we learned that our universe is not sta@@ tic , that space is exp@@ and@@ ing , that that expan@@ sion is spee@@ ding up and that there might be other univer@@ ses all by carefully exam@@ ining fa@@ int pin@@ points of star@@ light coming to us from dist@@ ant galaxies .
the most important discovery we made in our focus on public action was to appreci@@ ate that the hard choices are not between good and evil , but between compe@@ ting goods .
maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
because , you see , dna is like a blu@@ e@@ print that tells living things what to make .
one is a super@@ market standard : white bread , pre-@@ pac@@ ka@@ ged , which i &apos;m told is called a wonder@@ bread .
we need to get over it so we can move beyond it , and our little brothers and our little si@@ sters , and one day our kids -- or our kids right now -- can watch and start to value the impact we can have on each other &apos;s lives more than money and power and ti@@ tles and influence .
i put it to you today that it is this system that is em@@ bo@@ died by china that is gather@@ ing moment@@ um am@@ on@@ gst people in the emerging markets as the system to follow , because they believe increasingly that it is the system that will promise the best and fa@@ st@@ est impro@@ v@@ ements in living standards in the shor@@ test period of time .
and because it was in union square park , right by a sub@@ way station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
any society can adop@@ t these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achie@@ ved after 1@@ 500 -- only faster .
so , dad gradu@@ ated harvard in 194@@ 6 , married my mom , and bought a house in le@@ x@@ ing@@ ton , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts , where the first sh@@ ots were fi@@ red against the british in 17@@ 75 , although we didn &apos;t actually hit any of them until con@@ cor@@ d .
well , i thought i had the answer to that one , and i said , &quot; skin color . &quot;
we began the project with an inter@@ im report , which quickly pulled together a lot of information that had been colle@@ cted on the subject by many , many researchers .
the ac@@ ou@@ sti@@ cian in the competition gave us cri@@ teri@@ a , which led to this com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized sche@@ me , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
the doctors , it seemed , never really had enough time for all the patients , try as they might .
we are the only ones who actually re@@ turned the a@@ ward for $ 5@@ 0,000 , because they didn &apos;t believe us , and we thought that they were actually ca@@ sting as@@ per@@ sions on the bar@@ e@@ foot architec@@ ts of ti@@ lon@@ ia .
now , what that means is that all of the organisms that live in the sea have evolved in this che@@ mo@@ stat@@ ted ocean , that &apos;s the reason that they &apos;re not able to respond or ada@@ pt to this ra@@ pid aci@@ di@@ fication that &apos;s going on right now .
&quot; and i felt so bad for this du@@ de that i took the l@@ ol@@ li@@ pop , and as soon as i did , you got this incredibly sever@@ e look on your face and you looked at my mom and my dad , and you said , &apos; look at that . look at that .
we are , should be , mor@@ ally commit@@ ted to being the heal@@ er of the world .
and that allows me to check my ti@@ mer dis@@ cre@@ tely , here , without ben@@ ding my el@@ bo@@ w .
we can say to our children , ok , done , that was our story . that passed .
blue che@@ ese , ran@@ ch , oil and v@@ ine@@ gar , thousand is@@ lands and house .
it &apos;s something that i &apos;ve worked on and a few other people , and it indi@@ c@@ ates a kind of hier@@ arch@@ y along with some assu@@ mp@@ tions about how many people stop at different steps and how the steps of thinking are affected a very different theory , a much more popular one , and an older one , due lar@@ gely to john n@@ ash of &quot; a beautiful mind &quot; f@@ ame , is what &apos;s called equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um analysis .
non@@ eth@@ eless , if we want to attra@@ ct deep down athei@@ sts to come out publi@@ c@@ ly , we &apos;re going to have find something better to stick on our ban@@ ner than &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y &quot; or &quot; tea@@ po@@ t ag@@ no@@ stic . &quot;
so we thought of an aug@@ mented reality app@@ lic@@ ation using a tab@@ let . let me show you just simul@@ ating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
but no , for the pro@@ test , they d@@ ressed all in white , no ma@@ ke@@ up .
we need relative fig@@ ures that are connected to other data so that we can see a ful@@ ler picture , and then that can lead to us changing our perspective .
and the phili@@ st@@ ine who is sent down , their mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or , is a giant .
now , fashion designers have the broad@@ est pal@@ ette imag@@ in@@ able in this creative industry .
so you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappe@@ ared .
you find eleph@@ ants , r@@ hin@@ os , mon@@ keys , pig@@ s , etc .
the critical innovation here is instead of our engineers , or our people saying which is the most relevant , we &apos;re going to go out and count what you , people out there on the web , for whatever reason -- van@@ ity , pleasure -- produced links , and ti@@ ed to each other . we &apos;re going to count those , and count them up .
and i remember , nat@@ as@@ ha didn &apos;t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time barri@@ c@@ ading the room .
this is what we are using . &quot;
and of course , by the time you get to the average work@@ place , maybe the best construction tool we have might be the post-@@ it notes . it &apos;s pretty bar@@ ren .
what i want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the western world -- australia , united states , u.k. and so on -- face in some of the de@@ plo@@ y@@ ments that they &apos;re dealing with in the modern world at this time .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stor@@ ed with that speci@@ alized spring , but the extre@@ mes of the flu@@ id dynam@@ ics . and they might actually be making use of flu@@ id dynam@@ ics as a second force for breaking the sna@@ il .
and the market research , consumer research , asking the bo@@ om@@ ers and gen y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &apos;re already seeing it -- for more urban lifest@@ y@@ les within sub@@ ur@@ bia .
but the problem with rel@@ ying on rules and in@@ centi@@ ves is that they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity , and they de@@ mor@@ alize professional activity in two senses .
and these doctors or these ma@@ sters , these spi@@ ritual ma@@ sters of the su@@ f@@ i tradition , re@@ fer to teach@@ ings and examples of our prop@@ he@@ t that teach us where the source of our problems lies .
and nan@@ o was , bang , 2,000 dollars .
research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagno@@ sed with autis@@ m are actually suffering from hidden brain sei@@ zur@@ es .
michael free at path says you have to figure out who will &quot; choose , use and pay the du@@ es &quot; for a product like this .
whenever it comes up to the mid@@ point , it p@@ aus@@ es , it carefully sc@@ ans the od@@ or interface as if it was s@@ ni@@ ff@@ ing out its environment , and then it turns around .
and so every time a new medium arri@@ ves , the old medium is the content , and it is highly obser@@ vable , highly notic@@ e@@ able , but the real , real rough@@ ing up and mas@@ sa@@ ging is done by the new medium , and it is ignor@@ ed .
tell us where we &apos;re going wrong . let &apos;s talk together about where religion is fail@@ ing . &quot;
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a bre@@ w -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average sc@@ ore in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
but all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustain@@ ability means basically looking at the glob@@ alized economic growth model , and moder@@ ating what comes in at one end , and moder@@ ating the out@@ puts at the other end .
jim coll@@ ins , the auth@@ or of &quot; good to great , &quot; told me that successful human organizations of any kind have two things in common : they preser@@ ve the core , they stimu@@ late progress .
i believe , if ken@@ ne@@ dy was alive today , he would be asking statisti@@ cians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life wor@@ th@@ while .
you take a problem that you can &apos;t solve with a p@@ ure mathematical answer , you build an evolutionary system to try multiple tries at gu@@ ess@@ ing , you add sex -- where you take half of one solution and half of another and then make new mu@@ tations -- and you use natural sele@@ ction to kill off not as good solutions .
and there are certain ob@@ li@@ ga@@ tions that should go with those benefits to be placed on the oper@@ ators , and the key one is , of course , that the oper@@ ators pay for everything , including all the inter@@ facing into the public sector .
it allows us to do the art , the biot@@ echn@@ ology , the software and all those magic things .
and people who are teachers out here , who@@ ever taught , you know this -- it &apos;s the inter@@ connections between ideas that teaching is really all about .
i &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re really the essen@@ ce of what makes for progress , even when they seem to be terrible .
we &apos;ve flo@@ wn the cas@@ sin@@ i spac@@ ec@@ raft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these je@@ ts , into the den@@ ser regi@@ ons of these je@@ ts , so that now we have come away with some very pre@@ cise com@@ posi@@ tional measu@@ re@@ ments .
sor@@ row , an@@ ger , m@@ our@@ ning .
and a lot of the time the question of par@@ en@@ tho@@ od is , what do we v@@ ali@@ date in our children , and what do we cure in them ?
and meaning , in this view , consi@@ sts of -- very par@@ alle@@ l to eu@@ da@@ im@@ on@@ ia -- it consi@@ sts of knowing what your highest streng@@ ths are , and using them to bel@@ ong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
and i remember thinking , &quot; this is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
i want to write about a tor@@ na@@ do that comes into our house and blo@@ ws all the windows out and ru@@ ins all the fur@@ ni@@ ture and kill@@ s everybody . &quot;
you can see the li@@ spen@@ ard me@@ a@@ do@@ ws dra@@ ining down through here , through what is tri@@ bec@@ a now , and the be@@ ach@@ es that come up from the battery , all the way to 4@@ 2@@ n@@ d st .
now , the weird thing is google lies , because if i type &quot; design and emotion , &quot; it says , &quot; you don &apos;t need the &apos; and . &apos; we do it anyway . &quot;
and over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4@@ ,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , for@@ cing water down through the cra@@ cks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a mag@@ ma cham@@ ber where it becomes super@@ he@@ ated and super@@ satur@@ ated with miner@@ als , rever@@ ses its flow and starts sho@@ ot@@ ing back to the surface and is e@@ je@@ cted out of the earth like a ge@@ y@@ ser at yel@@ lo@@ w@@ stone .
we are increasingly off@@ ered a diet in which sen@@ sation , not story , is king .
our problem and our trage@@ dy is that in these hyper@@ -@@ par@@ tis@@ an times , the m@@ ere fact that one side says , &quot; look , there &apos;s an astero@@ id , &quot; means that the other side &apos;s going to say , &quot; hu@@ h ? what ?
we realized that when plasti@@ cs get to the du@@ mp , it &apos;s difficult to sort them because they have similar den@@ si@@ ties , and when they &apos;re mix@@ ed with organic matter and construction de@@ br@@ is , it &apos;s truly impossible to pick them out and environ@@ ment@@ ally elimin@@ ate them .
and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait , but then the engineers , when they finally did get there , for the third time , they had to call somebody .
we talk about this a lot , and i thought about trying to give an example of this . so , just one example : ma@@ d@@ ame de g@@ au@@ lle , the wife of the french president , was fam@@ ously asked once , &quot; what do you most desire ? &quot;
the care@@ ful testing , re@@ testing , design , are going to open up vi@@ st@@ as of understanding , comple@@ xi@@ ties , difficult things .
studies for the structure of the roof , which dem@@ ands maybe new materials : how to make it white , how to make it trans@@ lu@@ cent , how to make it glo@@ wing , how to make it not cap@@ ri@@ cious .
all they have , really , is tra@@ de@@ mark protection , and so it means that anybody could copy any gar@@ ment on any person in this room and sell it as their own design .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to conc@@ ei@@ ve of an architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation that sli@@ des se@@ am@@ less@@ ly through the project &apos;s and the cli@@ ent &apos;s con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts ?
the laws of physics : invisible , e@@ ternal , om@@ ni@@ present , all@@ -@@ powerful .
t@@ m : oh , 10 , 11 .
so this is the foot@@ age he photograph@@ ed , and it was pretty moving and pretty a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing .
in the ne@@ ther@@ lands -- where i come from -- you actually never see a pi@@ g , which is really strange , because , on a population of 16 million people , we have 12 million pig@@ s .
i think that is wrong .
what that means is that what we &apos;re learning with these inter@@ actions with other species will teach us , ultimately , how we might interact with an alien from another world .
one thing you can do with a picture like this is simply ad@@ mi@@ re it .
so i just want to say a couple more things about that particular story , and then try to gener@@ alize how could we have stories of success all over the place for these diseases , as sam says , these 4@@ ,000 that are waiting for answers .
just in the past couple years , we &apos;ve seen digital tools display skills and abilities that they never , ever had before , and that , kind of , eat deeply into what we human beings do for a living . let me give you a couple examples .
basically i &apos;m recor@@ ding one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life , chron@@ ologi@@ cally comp@@ il@@ ing these one-@@ second tiny sli@@ ces of my life into one single continu@@ ous video until , you know , i can &apos;t record them anymore .
these were the fe@@ ars that dan@@ ced in the imag@@ in@@ ations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they cho@@ se to listen to would gover@@ n whether they lived or died .
and so therefore , the entire purpose of a v@@ c pit@@ ch is to convince them that you are the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return .
we paid them 10 cents per cor@@ rect question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per cor@@ rect question .
see , mr. h@@ unter is doing that because he says his time has mess@@ ed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
dan o &apos;@@ bri@@ en jum@@ ped 5 &apos; 11 &quot; in &apos; 9@@ 6 in atlan@@ ta , i mean , if it just gives you a compar@@ ison of -- these are truly ac@@ compli@@ shed ath@@ le@@ tes , without quali@@ fying that word &quot; ath@@ le@@ te . &quot;
your job as a leader -- this is definitely a team sport -- your job as a leader is to try to inspi@@ re them to do more work than they &apos;ve ever done in their life under conditions that they can &apos;t imagine .
were all of us the results of things done to us , done for us , the in@@ fi@@ deli@@ ty of a par@@ ent or spo@@ use , money in@@ her@@ ited ?
we do like to consu@@ me , but every time one of these new tools came along , it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have stri@@ ved to understand cancer .
and i really understood what patient capital meant emotion@@ ally in the last month or so . because the company was literally 10 days away from pro@@ ving that the product they produced was at the worl@@ d-@@ quality level needed to make co@@ ar@@ tem , when they were in the biggest c@@ ash crisis of their history .
and i think g@@ ali@@ le@@ o su@@ mm@@ ed up , very ni@@ c@@ ely , the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us .
now , 18 years later , i &apos;m proud to tell you , last year we f@@ ed two million people in 35 countries through our foundation , all during the ho@@ li@@ days : th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving , christ@@ mas -- -- in all the different countries around the world .
you have to say , well , black@@ ness of skin , you couldn &apos;t suff@@ er just for that .
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analy@@ ze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ster makes this world , &quot; by le@@ wi@@ s hy@@ de .
i &apos;ve also come to believe that roman@@ tic love is an addi@@ ction : a perfectly wonderful addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going well , and a perfectly horri@@ ble addi@@ ction when it &apos;s going poor@@ ly .
one of the things i had to learn as a journalist was what to do with my an@@ ger .
do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
i thought , well that &apos;s not good enough .
the service provi@@ ders , well , for the first time , they &apos;ve got an opportunity to provide services and grow the evidence for what they &apos;re doing in a really con@@ struc@@ tive way and learn and demon@@ strate the value of what they &apos;re doing over five or six years , not just one or two as often happens at the moment .
and i liked making that book because i loved using my imagination , and that &apos;s what writing is .
she wrote all her own software to design and built this dna origami , a beautiful ren@@ di@@ tion of china , which even has ta@@ i@@ w@@ an , and you can see it &apos;s sort of on the world &apos;s shor@@ test le@@ ash , right ?
and all i can really do is hope , not to poli@@ cy@@ makers or politicians , because as much as i &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , i don &apos;t del@@ u@@ de myself .
and what was so sad about this particular story was that once their parents had found out -- and don &apos;t forget , their parents took them to the doctor -- the parents thre@@ w them out on the street .
as we try to build this view , and try to educ@@ ate ourselves about the enor@@ m@@ ity of our culture , the information that we have to work with is these gigan@@ tic numbers : numbers in the millions , in the hundreds of millions , in the billions and now in the trilli@@ ons .
and after two more years of studying music , i decided to sho@@ ot for the impossible before taking the mc@@ at and appl@@ ying to medical school like a good indian son to become the next dr. gu@@ p@@ ta .
the babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
mit resear@@ cher de@@ b ro@@ y wanted to understand how his inf@@ ant son learned language -- so he wired up his house with vide@@ oc@@ ameras to catch every moment of his son &apos;s life , then par@@ sed 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video to watch &quot; ga@@ a@@ a@@ a &quot; slowly turn into &quot; water . &quot; ast@@ on@@ ishing , dat@@ a-@@ rich research with deep impli@@ cations for how we learn .
i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s mountain bi@@ king or reading a book or playing a game .
generally , what you see in green is not deser@@ ti@@ fying , and what you see in brown is , and these are by far the greatest areas of the earth .
and then as we start to define what does ste@@ ep@@ ness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measu@@ re@@ ments to really nar@@ row it down , specifically what that means .
we &apos;re going to go on a di@@ ve to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lo@@ vely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly posi@@ tively pit@@ ch@@ -@@ black world .
well , my dream of becoming a teacher will not come to pass .
you may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there but you know to demand it .
and what i want you to do is picture her as a chinese woman recei@@ ving a chinese fla@@ g because her loved one has died in america in the coal u@@ pris@@ ing .
i want them to get the media involved because the media are cru@@ cial in helping to dis@@ solve some of the stere@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical vie@@ ws we have of other people , which are divi@@ ding us from one another .
can you imagine saying to your co@@ ach , &quot; u@@ h , i &apos;m not really feeling it today , i think i &apos;ll sit this game out . &quot;
one is the large global economy , the large glob@@ alized economy , and the other one is the small , and very limited , capacity of our traditional governments and their international institutions to gover@@ n , to shape , this economy .
i had my own heart sc@@ are years ago in graduate school , when we &apos;re under treatment for the kid@@ ney , and suddenly , they &apos;re like , &quot; oh , we think you have a heart problem . &quot;
and you know , with the future billions that we &apos;ve been hearing about , the world is simply far too complex to understand in that way .
okay , just wait for this one . this is good .
so , the next to last thing i want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satis@@ fac@@ tion people have .
the phr@@ ase that you want , if you &apos;re a graduate student or a post@@ do@@ c or you &apos;re a professor , a 3@@ 8@@ -year-old economics professor , is , &quot; i &apos;m an em@@ pi@@ ri@@ c@@ ist .
rb : ah , that was quite fun . that was a wonderful car@@ -@@ boat in which -- oh , that car that we -- actually we -- it was a ted@@ ster event there , i think .
so , &quot; related sear@@ ches , &quot; right there . you can &apos;t see it that well , but we decided we should put in this fe@@ ature into our ad@@ sense ads , called &quot; related sear@@ ches . &quot;
so , you know , when a school bus is blo@@ wn up and we &apos;ve never seen this before , our general tenden@@ cy is to ori@@ ent towards that which is new and novel is activ@@ ated .
hell@@ a jon@@ geri@@ us is a person that is able to make a syn@@ thesis that is really quite amazing and also quite hil@@ ari@@ ous .
and of course , everybody got it . everybody went , &quot; yes , of course , you &apos;re absolutely right .
at a re@@ ception in their cour@@ ty@@ ard , i noticed that they had a foun@@ tain because they think that the people who go to the museum deser@@ ve a foun@@ tain .
if you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are un@@ able to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over@@ -@@ frag@@ mented ; it &apos;s made up of a col@@ lage , a pat@@ ch@@ work , of regi@@ ons of different colors and l@@ umin@@ an@@ ces .
i was a student in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , a time of social up@@ hea@@ val and questi@@ oning , and on a personal level , an a@@ wa@@ ken@@ ing sense of ide@@ alism .
in a traditional classroom , you have a couple of home@@ work , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , home@@ work , lec@@ ture , and then you have a s@@ nap@@ shot ex@@ am .
and yes , you also interact using natural gest@@ ures , both hands , etc .
i also learned , don &apos;t reve@@ al your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my com@@ ics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .

imagine you &apos;re driving in a fo@@ g . that makes a difference between seeing the car in front of you and avo@@ i@@ ding the accident , or getting into an accident .
it &apos;s time again to talk about &quot; in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth , &quot; a truth that everyone is concerned about , but nobody is willing to talk about .
and these two mis@@ sions , as you can tell , thre@@ ad together perfectly . one ad@@ ds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
well , since i &apos;m not seeing the hand , it appe@@ ars that what i &apos;m stat@@ ing is true .
now that you &apos;re done looking at those , close them down , because every phone has something in common .

there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang pu@@ ck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
now i have learned that my place is not just in the west or in africa , and i &apos;m still se@@ arch@@ ing for my identity , but i saw ghana create democracy better .
animal fan n@@ ell@@ ie m@@ ck@@ ay s@@ ings a spar@@ kl@@ ing tribu@@ te to her de@@ ar dog . she suggests we all do the same : &quot; just go right to the po@@ und / and find yourself a ho@@ und / and make that do@@ g@@ gie proud / &apos; cause that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about . &quot;
so when we have a robot which is surro@@ unded by neighb@@ ors -- and let &apos;s look at robot i and robot j -- what we want the robots to do is to monit@@ or the separ@@ ation between them as they fly in forma@@ tion .
so if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new tar@@ gets for which drugs could be designed or scre@@ en@@ ed against , or maybe places where electro@@ des could be put in for people who have very sever@@ e dis@@ ability .
and the species in the soil go to work basically che@@ wing through those roots , de@@ com@@ pos@@ ing them -- the earth@@ wor@@ ms , the f@@ ung@@ i , the bacteria -- and the result is new soil .
i &apos;m working with a young computer@@ -@@ anima@@ tor docum@@ ent@@ arian named ni@@ ck de@@ am@@ er , and this is a little dem@@ o that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
and then god looked to the future and realized , if the world was created just with justice , the world couldn &apos;t exist .
for those of us in this room , it &apos;s not just the poor@@ est and the most vulnerable individual , it &apos;s the community , it &apos;s the culture , it &apos;s the world itself .
early diagno@@ sis of autis@@ m spectrum dis@@ order can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at tedx@@ pe@@ ach@@ tree , ami kli@@ n descri@@ bes a new early dete@@ ction method that uses e@@ ye@@ -@@ tracking technologies to g@@ auge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reli@@ ably measure their risk of developing autis@@ m . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
for example , g@@ arb@@ age dis@@ charge , something you would think just simply goes away , but the laws regul@@ ating ship dis@@ charge of g@@ arb@@ age actually get we@@ ak@@ er the further you are from sh@@ ore .
well , pretty soon they were bar@@ ra@@ ged with en@@ ra@@ ged letters , death thre@@ ats , ban on the top@@ ic in a number of scientific journ@@ als , coming from i@@ rate le@@ ft@@ -@@ h@@ anders and their ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ates , and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the ven@@ om and vi@@ tu@@ per@@ ation that they had in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently inspired .
&quot; i &apos;m sorry . i &apos;ve only got 18 minutes , 18 minutes to talk about saving the world , saving the planet , global institutions .
i think you can really en@@ rich the way we brow@@ se our photographs and bring it to that kind of sho@@ e@@ box of , you know , photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing .
she wrote back to me and she said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to have a son that created the software that allowed these kids to make mother &apos;s day cards for their mothers . &quot;
everything is not predic@@ table : the stock market is , at least for me , not predic@@ table , but most complicated negoti@@ ations are predic@@ table .
meaning that you know you have no auth@@ ority to change anything .
and reading that book made me re@@ exam@@ ine that theory because i need to explain what i mean by that .
no one is better at this activity of actually getting us to engage in deli@@ vering services , sometimes where none exist , than us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
at the same time , while i was intervie@@ wing the red bri@@ ga@@ des , i also discovered that their life was not rul@@ ed by politics or ide@@ ology , but actually was rul@@ ed by economics .
but i will demon@@ strate different ways to get rid of diffic@@ ul@@ ties and go to the point , to find an answer probably much quick@@ er than ar@@ th@@ ur did . so , first , we viol@@ ate the common sense , the lo@@ gic . all of you , if you hold your hand like this , 90 degrees -- all of you . not you .
soft power is a concept invented by a harvard acade@@ mic , jo@@ se@@ ph n@@ ye , a friend of mine .
when we ask them and tell them what we need , one of my wor@@ ries today is that we have many foun@@ da@@ tions now .
it &apos;s the only way to get our freedom back , and it &apos;s the only way to rele@@ ase the energy and passion needed so that we can meet the challenges of our time . thank you .
i think our tenden@@ cy is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time . but we don &apos;t do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality .
so , if we use information that comes off of this spe@@ cular refle@@ ction , we can go from a traditional face scan that might have the gro@@ ss cont@@ ours of the face and the basic shape , and aug@@ ment it with information that puts in all of that skin po@@ re structure and fine wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es .
my dad actually res@@ ig@@ ned from the mal@@ e-@@ only business club in my home@@ town because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day wel@@ come his son , but not his daughter .
these drugs were brought to market . they were pres@@ cri@@ bed very wid@@ ely because heart attac@@ ks are a very common thing , and it took so long for us to find out that these drugs also caused an increas@@ ed rate of death that before we dete@@ cted that safety signal , over 100,000 people died un@@ necessarily in america from the pres@@ cri@@ ption of anti-@@ ar@@ rhyth@@ mic drugs .
because that co@@ s@@ mic basic idea that it is us all alone , each of us , and everyone else is different , then that puts us in an impossible situation , doesn &apos;t it ?
so if we start to think exponenti@@ ally , we can see how this is starting to affect all the technologies around us .
it &apos;s usually 90 percent . so , you tell me you sleep better than expected .
so to inv@@ o@@ ke another metaphor , if you imagine social networks as a kind of vast fabri@@ c of humanity -- i &apos;m connected to you and you to her , on out end@@ less@@ ly into the distance -- this fabri@@ c is actually like an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned american qu@@ il@@ t , and it has pat@@ ches on it : happy and un@@ happy pat@@ ches .
there &apos;s been an explosion of collabor@@ ative consumption -- web@@ -@@ powered sharing of cars , a@@ part@@ ments , skills . ra@@ ch@@ el bot@@ s@@ man explor@@ es the cur@@ ren@@ cy that makes systems like air@@ b@@ n@@ b and tas@@ kr@@ ab@@ bit work : trust , influence , and what she calls &quot; repu@@ tation capital . &quot;
bo@@ one , i really , really appreci@@ ate you coming here , eng@@ aging in this conversation .
and because i have a 15@@ -year-old , all i do is co@@ ok and co@@ ok and co@@ ok .
and my relationship to especially human@@ -@@ made objects which someone else said they work like this , well , i can say they work a different way , a little bit .
it was the hon@@ ey in the water that made it swe@@ et , it was the oil that made it sick .
the country on its own up at the top is a place i haven &apos;t been to .
&quot; um , ab@@ ed , &quot; i said , &quot; i thought you had a few driving issues before the crash . &quot;
the problem is that , if i &apos;m this do@@ c , and i get your ct scan today and you &apos;ve got a two centi@@ meter mass in your li@@ ver , and you come back to me in three months and it &apos;s three centi@@ meters , did that drug help you or not ?
now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a con@@ dom .
now , this one is blue , and that &apos;s the color of most bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence in the ocean because evolution has sel@@ ec@@ ted for the color that tra@@ vels far@@ th@@ est through se@@ a@@ water in order to optimi@@ ze communication .
you &apos;re too ke@@ en . you &apos;re too ke@@ en . no . hang on . hang on .
and as you see here , there are groups that are growing on top of each other , because they are spre@@ ading .
he &apos;s all mur@@ ky . there is little kids le@@ an@@ ing on his leg , little g@@ ho@@ sts flying around . we got@@ ta clean this stuff up fast , ladies and gentle@@ men .
you can &apos;t really dis@@ pu@@ te what you see on the video , and there is a lot to be learned from that , and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a prof@@ ession when we actually get to see this .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psych@@ ic , ma@@ gical power@@ s that they can predict the future , that they can make contact with the de@@ ce@@ ased .
so there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is china -- the civili@@ za@@ tion@@ -@@ state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
all right , how many swe@@ dis@@ h decisi@@ on@@ makers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , u.@@ s@@ .@@ -@@ based services , like , you know , run windows or o@@ s@@ x , or use facebook or lin@@ ke@@ d@@ in , or store their data in clou@@ ds like ic@@ l@@ oud or sky@@ drive or dro@@ p@@ box , or maybe use online services like ama@@ zon web services or sal@@ es support ?
i tried to understand that language as a beginning , as a place to jump off , and there was so much of it being done by spe@@ c buil@@ ders and it was tri@@ vi@@ alized so much that it wasn &apos;t ...
so it started out with some work i was involved in in ir@@ eland , where i was teaching , and has since spread .
now , that was a terrible decision for me to have to make , and it was political dynam@@ ite , frank@@ ly .
then you notice that if that le@@ go@@ -@@ provi@@ ded c@@ ad program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-@@ source , thir@@ d-@@ party , independent le@@ go c@@ ad program that lets you do 3d mod@@ el@@ ing and 3d ren@@ der@@ ing and make , in fact , movies out of le@@ go , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mi@@ mi@@ cking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people re@@ creating all sorts of things .
and the more you try to think about it , the further the answer gets from you , and the minute you stop thinking about it , your intuition gives you that answer , in a sense .
100 years after sir ern@@ est sha@@ ck@@ le@@ ton wrote these words , i in@@ tend to plant an industrial fla@@ g on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space fron@@ tier , in our time , for all of us .
think about it : what other business do you know , what other sector of the economy , and especially one as big as the public sector , that doesn &apos;t se@@ ek to rein@@ vent its business model on a regular basis ?
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through the lo@@ bby with our own little dan@@ g@@ ly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads you into the audi@@ tor@@ ium .
what &apos;s really insu@@ l@@ ting about this is not only does it provide the attac@@ kers with access to your data , but when the scan fin@@ ish@@ es , they tell you in order to clean up the fa@@ ke viruses , you have to regi@@ ster the product .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
when i learned , some years ago , that wri@@ ters were expected to have had really un@@ happy child@@ ho@@ ods to be successful , i began to think about how i could inv@@ ent horri@@ ble things my parents had done to me .
because the thing is , we are so ch@@ au@@ v@@ ini@@ stic to biology , if you take away carbon , there &apos;s other things that can happen .
so it &apos;s small tra@@ des by small people , but it &apos;s very in@@ formed , safe , conven@@ i@@ ent , low-@@ over@@ head and immedi@@ ate .
the first is sel@@ ec@@ ting a feed@@ stock , pre@@ fer@@ ably something that &apos;s regi@@ onal , that &apos;s in your area , right -- local manufacturing .
but , most importantly , while i was travel@@ ing , i taught children carto@@ oning , and in exchange , i learned how to be spon@@ tane@@ ous .
they were asked to design , replace that bridge in six weeks , building it , including all of the parts , manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red .
this is bir@@ han , who was the ethi@@ op@@ ian girl who launched live aid in the 198@@ 0s , 15 minutes away from death when she was res@@ cu@@ ed , and that picture of her being res@@ cu@@ ed is one that went round the world .
and i didn &apos;t think anything more of it until the following year , when it happened again , and then the year after that , and then the year after that .
so now , if you take this metaphor &#91; of &#93; genome as program seriously , you have to consider that chris ander@@ son is a computer@@ -@@ fabri@@ cated arti@@ fact , as is jim wat@@ son , cra@@ ig vent@@ er , as are all of us .
and then the com@@ post is all taken back to the roo@@ fs of the city , where we &apos;ve got far@@ ming , because what we &apos;ve done is li@@ f@@ ted up the city , the landscape , into the air to -- to re@@ store the na@@ tive landscape on the roo@@ fs of the buildings .
one of the fo@@ under@@ s went to swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land , saw it imple@@ mented some@@ place , said , &quot; wow , that looks really cool .
to@@ y@@ ota , instead of tre@@ ating its supp@@ li@@ ers as a market@@ place , tre@@ ats them as a network and tra@@ ins them to produce better , even though they are also training them to produce better for their competi@@ tors .
al ja@@ ze@@ era brought information to them , showed them what was being said and done in the name of their religion , ex@@ posed the hypo@@ cris@@ y of o@@ sam@@ a bin laden and al q@@ a@@ e@@ da , and allowed them , gave them the information that allowed them to come to their own conclu@@ sions .
this idea is ni@@ c@@ ely cap@@ tured by this quote : &quot; things without all reme@@ dy should be without reg@@ ard ; what &apos;s done is done . &quot;
i kept thinking of be@@ ds and red che@@ e@@ ks , and of course i kept thinking of sex when i looked at him , and i thought , is that what he &apos;s thinking about ?
so we would have a live website , that every single day of the 3@@ 3 days , we would be blog@@ ging , telling stories of , you know , de@@ ple@@ ted o@@ zone for@@ cing us to cover our faces , or we will burn .
we &apos;ve spent a great deal of time investi@@ g@@ ating a $ 1 billion -- that &apos;s right , a $ 1 billion â oil deal that he was involved with , and what we found was pretty sho@@ cking , but more about that later .
and pretty soon , they began shi@@ pping that coal , ton by ton , ra@@ il car by ra@@ il car , bo@@ at@@ load by bo@@ at@@ load , back to china and el@@ se@@ where around the world .
like sa@@ d@@ dam , like mu@@ gabe , like k@@ im jon@@ g-@@ il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions .
it turns out that freedom -- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those deli@@ cious fu@@ tures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
anima@@ tion , software , mo@@ vie@@ making software , they have it all .
from the minute a child &apos;s taught how to play an instrument , he &apos;s no longer poor .
come with me to the bottom of the world , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , the highest , dri@@ est , win@@ dies@@ t , and yes , col@@ dest region on earth -- more ar@@ id than the sahar@@ a and , in parts , col@@ der than mars .
they &apos;d given me a large gr@@ ant when i was an acade@@ mi@@ cian for the study of fel@@ ony dr@@ un@@ ken dri@@ vers , and i thought i had a pretty good track record , and by the time i had spent half an hour talking about play , it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious .
the key though in all of these , the red thre@@ ad , is the shift in min@@ d@@ set , moving away from a situation where we simply are pus@@ hing ourselves into a dark future , where we instead back@@ cast our future , and we say , &quot; what is the playing field on the planet ?
the cul@@ min@@ ation of this is if you &apos;ve success@@ fully raised your ta@@ d@@ pole , obser@@ ving the behavi@@ oral and develop@@ mental events , you will then go and introdu@@ ce your ta@@ d@@ pole to its nam@@ es@@ a@@ ke and disc@@ uss the evidence that you &apos;ve seen .
so let &apos;s step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve , el@@ ev@@ ate , the terms of political dis@@ course in the united states , and for that matter , around the world .
over the past seven years , i &apos;ve been following my fascin@@ ation with the built environment , and for those of you who know me , you would say that this obs@@ ession has led me to live out of a su@@ it@@ case 3@@ 65 days a year .
so , as i say before the last piece , feel not as though it is a sphere we live on , rather an infin@@ ite plane which has the illusion of leading yourself back to the point of orig@@ in .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
so she &apos;s even more glam@@ or@@ ous if you know that she really wasn &apos;t stupid , even though she thought she could look stupid .
actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neu@@ tra@@ l place for ex@@ changes and discus@@ sions , and then en@@ ables you to change the world .
as a si@@ del@@ ine , you know that the only red fla@@ g that po@@ pped up here was a sub@@ marine from an un@@ named country that plan@@ ted a red fla@@ g at the bottom of the arc@@ tic to be able to control the oil resources .
but we sent -- thought , ok , if we &apos;re going to need to do this , let &apos;s do it in-@@ library .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses inv@@ ent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are emplo@@ yed giving them mas@@ sages .
so sur@@ ely if a patent pool could be establi@@ shed to ra@@ mp up the production of military air@@ planes , we should be able to do something similar to t@@ ack@@ le the hiv / aids epidemic .
and yet , there is one great problem with movement , and that is that it &apos;s really hard to get your be@@ ar@@ ings when you &apos;re in mi@@ da@@ ir .
i &apos;ll go you one stran@@ ger than that : in 197@@ 4 , during the production of a weird com@@ e@@ dy sequ@@ el to &quot; the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on , &quot; called &quot; the black bird , &quot; star@@ ring george se@@ g@@ al , the los angeles coun@@ ty museum of art had a pla@@ ster original of the mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on -- one of the original six pla@@ sters , i think , made for the movie -- stol@@ en out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publi@@ city st@@ unt for the movie .
this allows you to pay it forward by using this subject as a ho@@ ok to science , because se@@ ti invol@@ ves all kinds of science , obviously biology , obviously astronom@@ y , but also ge@@ ology , also chemistry , various scientific discipl@@ ines all can be pres@@ ented in the gu@@ ise of , &quot; we &apos;re looking for e@@ .@@ t@@ . &quot;
when sen@@ ior fellow c@@ es@@ ar har@@ ada heard about the de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing effects of the b@@ p oil sp@@ ill in the gul@@ f of mexico in 2010 , he qu@@ it his dream job and moved to new or@@ le@@ ans to develop a more efficient way to so@@ ak up the oil . he designed a highly man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able , flexi@@ ble boat capable of cle@@ an@@ ing large tra@@ cts quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has op@@ ted to open-@@ source the design .
it took me a while ; it took me years to find the right ballo@@ on team to build the ballo@@ on that would do this job .
you all recognize that one . this is the mo@@ st-@@ played tun@@ e in the world today .
our in@@ ability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money , &quot; sit down . &quot;
am@@ ih@@ ot@@ or@@ not@@ .com -- everyday 25@@ 0,000 people go to this site , run by two volunte@@ ers , and i can tell you they are hard gra@@ ders , and they didn &apos;t get this way by adverti@@ sing a lot .
because it &apos;s shown the way we apply , generate and use knowledge is affected by our social and institu@@ tional context , which told us what in commun@@ ism ?
they are the result of a young team of very tal@@ ented people : physical therap@@ ists , neuro@@ bi@@ ologists , neuro@@ surge@@ ons , engineers of all kinds , who have achie@@ ved together what would have been impossible by single individuals .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the terri@@ tory of myster@@ y -- encoura@@ ging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stran@@ ger , in the face of the vi@@ br@@ ant religious other .
i mean , you &apos;d think this is the result of some tab@@ le@@ top experiment , but this is the result of worldwide cha@@ o@@ tic behavior -- countries acc@@ using each other of du@@ mp@@ ing products , ipo@@ s , bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cies , marketing programs .
li@@ ke@@ wise , with solar , especially here in california , we &apos;re disco@@ vering that the 80 solar farm sch@@ em@@ es that are going forward want to basically bu@@ ll@@ do@@ ze 1,000 square miles of southern california desert .
now i was stupid , but not so stupid that i turned it down .
the other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to co@@ operate am@@ on@@ gst others .
we are living among those men : they &apos;re our brothers , fa@@ thers , un@@ cles , cou@@ s@@ ins , all around us .
what i &apos;ve been doing from 14 to 17 was , i was assi@@ sting them colle@@ cting i@@ vor@@ y t@@ us@@ k , meat and whatever they were killing , po@@ ach@@ ing , hun@@ ting in the forest , bring it in the main city to get access to the market .
has anyone here wonder@@ ed what will happen if you go back to your room at night , and you start getting ch@@ est pa@@ ins , shor@@ t@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating ?
we are bl@@ essed with a language , a system of communication , so powerful and so pre@@ cise that we can share what we &apos;ve learned with such pre@@ c@@ ision that it can accu@@ mu@@ late in the collective memory .
i remember we cri@@ ed prof@@ us@@ ely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
i mean , i couldn &apos;t take your phones off you if i wanted to .
now there &apos;s several thoughts . there &apos;s e@@ . it could be i@@ . it could be a , but certainly not b , c or d , right ?
now , all of these big things for love -- experiments -- aren &apos;t going to take off .
the other thing is , you know , it would be even better if you didn &apos;t have to draw the blood .
so when people &apos;s symptom@@ s go away , they tend to re@@ cu@@ r , because there isn &apos;t a sense of the other half -- of what pleasure , happiness , compassion , gra@@ titude , what are the positive emotions .
it &apos;s not a new product or a new process but a new way to organi@@ ze work , and the most significant management innovation to come out of india , invented by the indian off@@ shor@@ ing industry is what we call the global deli@@ very model .
really , we &apos;re doing this , basically . really , not very much .
it &apos;s really man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able . you have a hand@@ -@@ held remote , so you can pretty easily control acceler@@ ation , bra@@ king , go in rever@@ se if you like , also have bra@@ king .
well , the world bank esti@@ mates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10@@ .@@ 3 -- to address mal@@ nutri@@ tion in those countries .
now the interesting thing is , repu@@ tation is the soci@@ o@@ economic lu@@ bri@@ c@@ ant that makes collabor@@ ative consumption work and scale , but the sources it will be gener@@ ated from , and its appli@@ cations , are far bigger than this space alone .
here we see people that feel &quot; sli@@ pping , &quot; &quot; n@@ au@@ se@@ ous , &quot; &quot; responsible . &quot;
we live in an age where some of the great break@@ through@@ s are not going to happen in the lab@@ s or the hall@@ s of acade@@ mi@@ a but on laptops , des@@ k@@ tops , in the pal@@ ms of people &apos;s hands who are simply helping out for the search .
and things got better and better , and within three or four months , i was dis@@ char@@ ged from that hospital , and i jo@@ ined a group of surge@@ ons where i could work with other people in the community , not in new haven , but fairly close by .
and hopefully , with their help , we &apos;ll learn how to live on this earth , and on this home that is ours , but not ours alone .
well birds are pretty har@@ d-@@ wired , as it happens , so most of that is already in their dna , but to supp@@ le@@ ment it , part of ben &apos;s idea is to use hom@@ ing pi@@ ge@@ ons to help train the young pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ ons how to flo@@ ck and how to find their way to their old ne@@ sting gro@@ unds and fe@@ eding gro@@ unds .
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these se@@ als that are very , very tiny .
and we don &apos;t just want people to see our movies and say , that was fun , and forget about it .
and if we can teach listening in our schools , we can take our listening off that sli@@ p@@ per@@ y slo@@ pe to that dangerous , sc@@ ary world that i talked about and move it to a place where everybody is consci@@ ously listening all the time -- or at least capable of doing it .
that &apos;s what we get from technology all the time . that &apos;s why people leave villa@@ ges and go into cities , is because they are always gravi@@ tat@@ ing towards increas@@ ed choices and possibilities .
when nan@@ cy lu@@ bli@@ n started tex@@ ting teen@@ a@@ gers to help with her social ad@@ vo@@ c@@ acy organization , what she found was sho@@ cking -- they started tex@@ ting back about their own problems , from bu@@ ll@@ ying to depression to ab@@ use . so she &apos;s setting up a tex@@ t-@@ only crisis line , and the results might be even more important than she expected .
here is the ch@@ art of over 4@@ 3 people helping to ste@@ er the robot that could not ste@@ er and get it on its way , from one corner from one corner of washington square park to another .
it &apos;s transpar@@ ent , and it allows you to understand , i think , what is always the most interesting thing in any building , which is the actual con@@ struc@@ tional processes that make it .
let me say par@@ en@@ the@@ tically why i think that &apos;s the case , because i think it &apos;s a poten@@ tially contro@@ versi@@ al stat@@ ement .
but one other extremely unique thing about bat@@ s is that they are able to use sound to percei@@ ve their environment . they use ech@@ olo@@ cation .
the yel@@ low-@@ green area is the flu@@ ids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also anti@@ bodies , sug@@ ars , hor@@ mon@@ es , that kind of thing .
well , you might actually imagine them to do all the kinds of smart things that humans do when they start ex@@ changing money with each other .
that &apos;s not good . hi . yeah . real bad . don &apos;t even look at me .
this image is quite interesting , actually , because i think we made it three years ago .
so unfortunately , this doesn &apos;t help this woman , but it does have sever@@ e , profound if you will , impli@@ cations to her family .
and you can say , &quot; that &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous , steve . what a du@@ m@@ b idea .
but it also takes a soft front -- the capacity to really be open to the world as it is , to have an un@@ defen@@ ded heart .
see , they asked me what i wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
it was sort of , in a certain sense , in a m@@ clu@@ han sense , an ex@@ ternal sto@@ mach , in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise .
and the reason is that until wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sli@@ ced bread , no one wanted it .
this is used in re@@ ference to a report in 2007 by the national research coun@@ cil in the united states , wher@@ ein they tried to understand how we can look for life el@@ se@@ where in the universe , okay , especially if that life is very different from life on earth . if we went to another planet and we thought there might be life there , how could we even recognize it as life ?
he goes and sees the gover@@ nor . the gover@@ nor says , bor@@ is ni@@ kol@@ a@@ ye@@ v@@ ich , i understand you are doing a great job , and you are the most respe@@ cted newspaper in our distri@@ ct .
our m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , rural and urban , play the oper@@ a@@ tional course of infrastructure -- things like waste dis@@ pos@@ al , energy demand , as well as social costs of un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , dro@@ p-@@ out rates , in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates and the im@@ pac@@ ts of various public health costs .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is really to say that we have , for a very long time , had a situation when we &apos;ve had a men@@ u of choices .
so i thank you for having the prop@@ he@@ tic imagination to imagine the sha@@ ping of a new world with us together , and invi@@ te you into this journey with us .
that &apos;s under@@ stand@@ able , but our experience with met suggests that if teachers manage the process , if they collect video in their own class@@ rooms , and they pick the lessons they want to sub@@ mit , a lot of them will be e@@ ager to participa@@ te .
specifically , we use these six design direc@@ tives , probably the most important being number two : we design with , not for -- in that , when we &apos;re doing human@@ it@@ ari@@ an-@@ focused design , it &apos;s not about designing for cli@@ ents anymore .
you know , a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
my point is that you don &apos;t have to be neu@@ tra@@ l to talk .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t matter what kind of se@@ di@@ ment you &apos;re using to gr@@ ind up , whether it &apos;s bacteria or any other plants or animals .
i mean , there would be an advantage to experi@@ en@@ cing our emotions inside , you know , an@@ ger or happiness .
we want to be able to build technologi@@ cal arti@@ facts that are maybe good for the world . we want to learn how to build biological arti@@ facts , like people and wh@@ ales and trees .
they have actually re@@ tain@@ ed access to the prof@@ it@@ able drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ Ã¡@@ n , and they control the port of l@@ Ã¡@@ zar@@ o c@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ den@@ as , they le@@ verage that to , for example , trade cop@@ per from mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ Ã¡@@ n that is leg@@ ally created and leg@@ ally extra@@ cted with illegal ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine from china which is a critical pre@@ cur@@ sor for meth@@ am@@ p@@ he@@ tam@@ ines that they produce , and then they have partner@@ ships with larger organizations like the sin@@ alo@@ a fe@@ der@@ ation that place their products in the u.@@ s .
and i was five years old , and i never understood why nasa didn &apos;t hi@@ re cap@@ tain kir@@ k and spo@@ ck to do the job ; after all , they were very profi@@ cient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a l@@ oud voice , it &apos;s too l@@ oud .
and then they don &apos;t have a regular check , but they have more opportunities to find more stuff , and they learn the sk@@ ill of negoti@@ ating , and they learn the sk@@ ill of finding opportunities as well .
there are very few doctors and , quite frank@@ ly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cop@@ e with such epide@@ mi@@ cs .
so as we are facing all the multiple cris@@ es in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gra@@ titude , effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess in our lives and be the best for our own care@@ ers is also what is best for the world .
and it goes all the way over to these big , thi@@ ck , gal@@ um@@ ph@@ y ones that have hundreds of carb@@ ons , and they have thousands of hydro@@ gens , and they have van@@ a@@ dium and heavy met@@ als and su@@ l@@ fu@@ r and all kinds of cra@@ z@@ iness han@@ ging off the sides of them .
it says a lot about her pe@@ ers who ele@@ cted her .
do they provide structure for us to do that ? and , you know , that &apos;s a personal relationship to expression that is l@@ ac@@ king in the technologi@@ cal sphere . so , you know , with dan , we needed a new design process , a new engineering process to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to per@@ form .
so i know it may sound like tough love , but look , if at some point you got lied to , it &apos;s because you agre@@ ed to get lied to .
they &apos;re not doing 26 miles ; they &apos;re doing 100 , 150 miles at a time , and appar@@ ently without in@@ j@@ ury , without problems .
it &apos;s what is meant by over@@ coming the hor@@ ror that we feel when we are under threat of our ene@@ mi@@ es , and beginning to appreci@@ ate the other .
years after he &apos;s had these drugs , i learned that everything he did to manage his ex@@ cess s@@ ali@@ va , including some positive side effects that came from other drugs , were making his con@@ sti@@ pa@@ tion worse .
as you can see at the top here , they share an up@@ -@@ swe@@ ep , like &quot; wo@@ op , wo@@ op , wo@@ op . &quot;
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
during the t@@ wen@@ tie@@ th century , we wit@@ n@@ essed the at@@ ro@@ cities of stal@@ in , hit@@ ler , ma@@ o , po@@ l po@@ t , r@@ wand@@ a and other geno@@ ci@@ des , and even though the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ first century is only seven years old , we have already wit@@ n@@ essed an on@@ going geno@@ cide in dar@@ fu@@ r and the daily hor@@ r@@ ors of iraq .
what we see of the real world is not the un@@ var@@ nis@@ hed world but a model of the world , regul@@ ated and ad@@ ju@@ sted by sense data , but constru@@ cted so it &apos;s useful for dealing with the real world .
it &apos;s not only something that suppor@@ ts trees , but something that conne@@ cts people and countries together .
and vis@@ iting some pretty incredible places , places like mon@@ go@@ li@@ a , cam@@ bo@@ dia , new gu@@ ine@@ a , south africa , tanz@@ ania twice -- i was here a month ago .
then mon@@ arch@@ y had seen off its big challen@@ ger , mass democracy , which was seen as a well-@@ inten@@ tioned but do@@ om@@ ed experiment , just as capit@@ alism has seen off soci@@ alism .
now to begin to over@@ come our ignor@@ ance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circu@@ it@@ ry , it &apos;s hel@@ p@@ ful to work on what we bi@@ ologists call &quot; model organisms , &quot; animals like fru@@ it flies and laboratory mi@@ ce , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to molecul@@ arly identify and pin@@ point specific clas@@ ses of neurons , as you heard about in all@@ an j@@ ones &apos;s talk this morning .
when we started out on the milk project , and when i started out , i couldn &apos;t have for@@ es@@ e@@ en that i would go from pur@@ su@@ ing my dream in politics and working at a des@@ k to tri@@ pping over a sha@@ dow and then turning people into pain@@ t@@ ings and painting on people in a pool of milk .
other examples you can see here are from lat@@ via , li@@ th@@ u@@ ania , est@@ on@@ ia -- the central european countries .
now , the group i really want you to think about , though , are the ones at the bottom , the foot soldiers .
it &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ate it , because i can see it compared to this thing , and i can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the ex@@ act same m@@ old that this one is .
after an hour in these conditions , it &apos;s so extreme that , when i go down , almost every di@@ ve i v@@ om@@ it into my regul@@ ator because my body can &apos;t deal with the stress of the cold on my head .
while we ini@@ tially her@@ al@@ ded the internet as the fantastic new marketing device that was going to solve all our problems , we now realize that the internet is , if anything , too effective in that reg@@ ard .
and if you lose where you are in your bio@@ sphere , or are perhaps having a diffic@@ ul@@ ty conne@@ cting with where you are in the bio@@ sphere , i would say to you , take a deep breath .
that if you live in the best climate , in san die@@ go in the united states , or in the sh@@ it@@ ti@@ est climate , in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , you are going to be just as happy in either place .
someone who has done something like this , however medi@@ oc@@ re and thro@@ wa@@ way , has tried something , has put something forward in public .
well , this has deep impli@@ cations about the limit@@ s of science , about predic@@ t@@ ability and controll@@ ability of things like biological processes or econom@@ ies , about intelligence in the universe , about questions like free will and about creating technology .
the first embra@@ ce is something that we think , &quot; oh , this is very easy , &quot; but it &apos;s actually getting harder , and that &apos;s paying attention to the world around us .
so , once you have mo@@ bility , now you &apos;re making a lot of eng@@ ines because you &apos;ve got lots of un@@ its , as op@@ posed to ste@@ am ships or big fac@@ tor@@ ies where you &apos;re not making as many un@@ its , so this was the engine that ended up benef@@ iting from mass production where all the other eng@@ ines didn &apos;t benefit .
now , typically you &apos;d think that they would all be the same : like , the cha@@ irs you &apos;re sitting in would all be the same dimension .
but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as sever@@ e , which has the same orig@@ ins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gen@@ cy .
i think usually , as companies get bigger , they find it really hard to have small , innovative projects .
i realized then that i , who thought i had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : my thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that der@@ i@@ ved from it .
and what they &apos;ve realized is that using violence in the situations they operate in is not only less human@@ e , but it &apos;s less effective than using metho@@ ds that connect people with people , that re@@ build .
the key thing is , even if you only have a couple of hours a month , those two hours shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der , next to one student , concent@@ r@@ ated attention , sh@@ ining this be@@ am of light on their work , on their thoughts and their self-@@ expression , is going to be absolutely transforma@@ tive , because so many of the students have not had that ever before .
hopefully , really understand the custom@@ er at its heart , where the custom@@ er is , live with them in america . so -- sent the team off , and actually something different happened . they went other places .
make it go away . make it go away . &quot;
and also tri@@ um@@ ph , this sense of tran@@ scen@@ dence , this &quot; i never knew that . ah , this is something new . &quot;
and for us young people , they &apos;re looking to become individuals and find their differences am@@ on@@ gst themselves .
world population , p@@ c plac@@ ements , the archi@@ ve of all the medical liter@@ ature , mo@@ ore &apos;s law , the old way of sequen@@ cing , and here &apos;s all the new stuff .
interest@@ ingly enough , other neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tan@@ gles of mis@@ fol@@ ded protein , which suggests that the approach might be a general one , and might be used to cure many neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases , not just alzheimer &apos;s disease .
and as soon as they had la@@ id all these , all their big st@@ ack of these je@@ wel@@ ed par@@ as@@ ols that they used to carry in ancient india , he per@@ formed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planet@@ ari@@ um , the wonder of the universe . everyone looked in that , and they saw in there the total inter@@ connec@@ te@@ dness of all life in all univer@@ ses .
what that might mean for cultural mov@@ ements all over this moment , the &quot; me , we &quot; seems incredibly pres@@ cient totally important .
and once we get enough of those guys , we &apos;re going to want more fan@@ t@@ asy artists that can create places we &apos;ve never been to before , or characters that we &apos;ve just never seen before .
so one way to test to see whether we can explain some of this behavior change by differences in life expec@@ tan@@ cy is to look and see is there more behavior change in areas where there &apos;s less malaria .
you know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and fig@@ ures , and they say , &quot; i know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
so i don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the web who are bil@@ ing@@ ual enough to help us trans@@ late .
a bank in paris held accoun@@ ts of companies controlled by him , one of which was used to buy the art , and american ban@@ ks , well , they fun@@ nel@@ ed 7@@ 3 million dollars into the states , some of which was used to buy that california man@@ sion .
it was cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed for glam@@ ori@@ zing violence , because , look -- sun@@ glas@@ ses and those long co@@ ats , and , of course , they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world .
and people who live in cities in the developed world tend to be very pro@@ sper@@ ous , and th@@ us use a lot of stuff .
and he rus@@ hed home . and after the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h , he made 12 lo@@ a@@ ves of bread , took them to the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , went into the sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue , opened the ar@@ k and said , &quot; god , i don &apos;t know why you want this bread , but here you are . &quot;
or the op@@ -@@ ed page , where if they knew the edi@@ tor -- had been to school with him , sle@@ pt with his wife -- they could write an article for the op@@ -@@ ed page .
there are two kinds of er@@ r@@ ors people make when trying to decide what the right thing is to do , and those are er@@ r@@ ors in esti@@ ma@@ ting the od@@ ds that they &apos;re going to succe@@ ed , and er@@ r@@ ors in esti@@ ma@@ ting the value of their own success .
the thing to watch for as a global phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y industry comes about -- and that &apos;s exactly what is happening -- is how the as@@ pi@@ ration is to fli@@ p these old assu@@ mp@@ tions , for phil@@ anth@@ rop@@ y to become open and big and fast and connected , in service of the long term .
ro@@ sa mexic@@ an@@ o restaurant , where he transpor@@ ts us to the shor@@ es of ac@@ ap@@ ul@@ co , up on the upp@@ er west side , with this wall of cli@@ ff diver@@ s who -- there you go , like that .
it doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
and as these dark clou@@ ds were cir@@ cl@@ ing me , and i was finding it really , really difficult to think of anything good , i said to myself that i really needed a way to focus on the positive somehow .
and i &apos;m also rather surprised , because when i look back on my life the last thing i ever wanted to do was write , or be in any way involved in religion .
you &apos;ve seen people take bene@@ ficial technologi@@ cal advan@@ ces , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about ton@@ ight , and twi@@ st them into something cor@@ rup@@ ting .
though in all seri@@ ousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , project glass .
and then she cl@@ ari@@ fied . she said , &quot; you know what , i don &apos;t mean that it su@@ cks . it means that i didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
and these are two an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es -- one was in cam@@ bo@@ dia , in a village that has no electricity , no water , no television , no tele@@ phone , but has broad@@ band internet now .
more recently , that power is un@@ te@@ ther@@ ing and le@@ ap@@ ing off the des@@ k@@ tops , and very , very quickly , we &apos;re going to see a significant propor@@ tion , if not the majority of the human race , walking around holding , carrying or wearing super@@ computers lin@@ ked at spee@@ ds greater than what we consider to be broad@@ band today .
i worked in other parts of new ze@@ al@@ and as well , in beautiful , fra@@ gi@@ le , prote@@ cted areas like in fi@@ ord@@ land , where this sea pen col@@ ony was found .
you need 20 interests , and then one of them , one of them might gra@@ b you , one of them might engage you more than anything else , and then you may have found your greatest love in compar@@ ison to all the other things that interest you , and that &apos;s what passion is .
in investi@@ g@@ ating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to un@@ cover deep tru@@ ths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
when jun@@ gi@@ an analy@@ st inge miss@@ ma@@ hl vis@@ ited afghanistan , she saw the inner wo@@ unds of war -- wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad des@@ pair , trau@@ ma and depression . and yet , in this coun@@ ty of 30 million people , there were only two do@@ zen psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . miss@@ ma@@ hl talks about her work helping to build the country &apos;s system of psycho@@ social coun@@ sel@@ ing , pro@@ mot@@ ing both individual and , perhaps , national heal@@ ing .
and it turned out that most people wouldn &apos;t come back , because it worked . but every once in a while , there was still a patient convinced that he was sick , and he &apos;d come back . and my dad had a third j@@ ar of p@@ ills .
so we grew up belie@@ ving no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lon@@ ely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their to@@ ol@@ shed .
so the contribu@@ tions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
so we called it y water . and so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-@@ dimensional design , the ideas , the brand@@ ing , it all becomes deeply connected .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply healthcare in a world in which cost is everything ?
but we haven &apos;t yet gotten to the point where on your way here this morning you see something that really , truly se@@ am@@ less@@ ly integr@@ ates the two-@@ dimensional world that we &apos;re comfortable in with the three-@@ dimensional sky above us -- that , i don &apos;t know about you , but i really enjoy spending time in .
and the thing you really hope for is occasi@@ on@@ ally they burn up , which we won &apos;t see ton@@ ight . so .
and the reason i think it would be so interesting to you is because consciousness is so interesting .
i need to get some new ones because the last meet i was at , they were everywhere . you know , it &apos;s like a big -- it &apos;s come full circle .
even the ones that believed they were getting better mat@@ ched the contro@@ ls exactly . exactly .
he pro@@ ved it was prime with nothing more than a qu@@ ill , ink , paper and his mind .
and so the next time you meet someone , a stran@@ ger , one requ@@ est : understand that you live in the subje@@ ctive truth , and so does he .
ye@@ men , civil war . united arab e@@ mi@@ rate , money which was quite equ@@ ally and well used .
so the data that you &apos;ve got is a great thing called youtube , and we can go down and basically pull all the open information from youtube , all the comm@@ ents , all the vie@@ ws , who &apos;s watching it , where are they watching it , what are they saying in the comm@@ ents .
these are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
a world tele@@ graph@@ y center -- imagine news , mes@@ sages , sounds , images deli@@ vered to any point in the world inst@@ antly and wir@@ el@@ ess@@ ly .
and then , what population of the earth would be an equ@@ ili@@ bri@@ um that could continue on , and be for 20@@ 50 , 2@@ 100 , 2@@ 150 ?
when we actually looked at not just self-@@ repor@@ ted political ori@@ entation , but vot@@ ing behavior , we were able to look geogra@@ phi@@ cally across the nation . what we found was that in regi@@ ons in which people repor@@ ted high levels of dis@@ g@@ ust sensi@@ tivity , mc@@ ca@@ in got more vot@@ es .
so i want you to rei@@ mag@@ ine a world with better air quality , better quality of life and better quality of living for everyone including our future generations .
and your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , na@@ ils -- everything is made of col@@ lagen .
and it &apos;s not only our memory , but those who remember us , which means that architecture is not mu@@ te .
but , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
i was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , i guess like all teen@@ a@@ gers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
you choose . it &apos;s your bak@@ ery , your street , your country -- not mine . &quot;
one that a lot of cultural cri@@ tics have poin@@ ted to is that we now have a much bro@@ a@@ der pal@@ ette of design choices to choose from than we ever have before , and this is main@@ ly because of the fast fashion industry , actually .
okay , part one starts back in 19@@ 29 when the great astronom@@ er ed@@ win hu@@ b@@ ble realized that the dist@@ ant galaxies were all rus@@ hing away from us , establi@@ sh@@ ing that space itself is stre@@ t@@ ching , it &apos;s exp@@ and@@ ing .
and then the bro@@ a@@ der ideas of c@@ it@@ y-@@ making start having direct influ@@ ences on architecture , on the elements that make up the bro@@ a@@ der sche@@ me , the buildings themselves , and start gui@@ ding us .
the problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and she@@ et@@ -@@ like at its dest@@ ination , but needs to be small for the journey .
it all began when two scientists , fre@@ d gras@@ s@@ le and j@@ esse au@@ su@@ bel , met in wo@@ ods hole , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ t@@ ts where both were gu@@ ests at the fam@@ ed oce@@ an@@ ogra@@ phic institute .
je@@ an v@@ ani@@ er says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , belo@@ ved , late friend mother ter@@ es@@ a -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &apos;s in the first instance about changing ourselves .
and when we do that what we discovered is that the circu@@ it@@ ry does change .
i was leaving a se@@ min@@ ar when it started , hum@@ ming to myself , f@@ um@@ bling with my bag just as i &apos;d done a hundred times before , when suddenly i heard a voice cal@@ m@@ ly obser@@ ve , &quot; she is leaving the room . &quot;
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict en@@ han@@ ced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an en@@ han@@ ced level .
so prepar@@ e@@ dness means that we can do stuff even when the things we take for gran@@ ted aren &apos;t there .
i &apos;d basically dist@@ ill@@ ed a very diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ explain and complex philosoph@@ y , which i won &apos;t get into here , because it &apos;s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &apos;s about what makes web@@ sites popular , and , you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s un@@ fortun@@ ate that i don &apos;t have more time .
and as much as there are great things around the corner -- and it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ able in this room -- of all of the things that are just about to break that can solve so many problems , i &apos;m really hop@@ ing that those things will spread around the world and will start to have a positive effect .
that story perfectly cap@@ tures for me the final lesson that i learned : happiness is not something we find , it &apos;s something we make .
sur@@ ely the kinds of play that at least american media give to -- and for@@ give me , but in ra@@ w numbers these are very tiny acci@@ dents .
so , one of our passi@@ ons in our company , and now one of my personal passi@@ ons , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , acc@@ essi@@ ble and aff@@ ord@@ able .
and , according to jes@@ us , the word comes forth , &quot; you must love yourself , you must love the l@@ ord your god with all your heart , mind and sou@@ l , and your neighb@@ or as yourself . &quot;
for us as individuals who live in the digital now and spend most of our wa@@ king moments in it , the challenge is to live in two stre@@ ams of time that are par@@ alle@@ l and almost simul@@ tane@@ ous .
and he liked to do an exercise with his students where he got them to take a piece of paper and draw the person who sat next to them , their neighb@@ or , very quickly , just as quickly as they could .
and what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , there &apos;s no real sense of separ@@ ation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that i feel for these people .
you know what i love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
and recently , i was in e@@ aster island , which is an incredibly beautiful place , and an incredibly myster@@ i@@ ous place , because no matter where you go in e@@ aster island , you &apos;re stru@@ ck by these stat@@ u@@ es , called the mo@@ ai .
and you know , we have a society , a world , that is paraly@@ zed by fear .
it was histor@@ ical . could it work in afghanistan with un@@ ama and who and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
and i said , first of all , let me do the calcu@@ lation on that com@@ po@@ und , bottom right , which is related to cou@@ mar@@ in , but has an extra p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on in@@ ser@@ ted into the molecule .
all that i want to tell you is that the reason that this has happened is because death pen@@ al@@ ty law@@ yers have understood that the earlier you interven@@ e in a case , the greater the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood that you &apos;re going to save your cli@@ ent &apos;s life .
well , the color@@ a@@ do on a typical day in the 195@@ 0s , this is just , you know , not a flo@@ od , not a dr@@ ought , kind of an average day , it looks something like this .
ma@@ car@@ th@@ ur w@@ inner sen@@ d@@ hi@@ l mul@@ la@@ in@@ a@@ than uses the l@@ ens of behavi@@ oral economics to study a tri@@ cky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child dea@@ ths due to di@@ arr@@ he@@ a , how to prevent diab@@ et@@ es@@ -@@ related blin@@ dness and how to imple@@ ment sol@@ ar-@@ cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?
well there &apos;s multiple different ways , such as ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans , which will ste@@ al money from your online ban@@ king accoun@@ ts when you do online ban@@ king , or key@@ log@@ gers .
you see , it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song , you needed a studio and a produ@@ cer .
technology in x-@@ ray where it &apos;s life@@ -@@ size process@@ ed , apart from these large car@@ go@@ -@@ scan@@ ning machines , hasn &apos;t moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resol@@ ution to be good enough for what i want to do with it , which is show my pictures big .
i &apos;m going to tell you two things today : one is what we have lost , and two , a way to bring it back .
because she fell in love with wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh , she was giving up the reasons she was a queen , and then wal@@ ter r@@ al@@ ei@@ gh fell in love with her lady in waiting , and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war or she wanted ...
in india , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they dep@@ end upon the breast , and the breast shows no son pre@@ ference .
and what is more important , because we want to get away from oil and diver@@ si@@ fy -- and there are so many opportunities in this one big country , as in many countries in africa -- what was remarkable is that much of this growth came not from the oil sector alone , but from non-@@ oil .
oh sure , sure , i had moments of appreci@@ ation of my body , the way an ab@@ u@@ sive par@@ ent can sometimes have a moment of kin@@ dness .
you probably know , if you &apos;ve been paying attention to some of the science liter@@ ature that you can now take a skin cell and encoura@@ ge it to become a li@@ ver cell or a heart cell or a kid@@ ney cell or a brain cell for any of us .
it &apos;s a custom@@ er , it &apos;s an audience , it &apos;s a person who &apos;s partici@@ p@@ ating .
now , what happened was not maybe what you thought , which is , he suddenly became passionate , enga@@ ged , involved , got a new teacher , he hit pu@@ ber@@ ty , or whatever it is .
and that is an idea that , i think , that paul richard bu@@ chan@@ an ni@@ c@@ ely put in a recent es@@ say where he said , &quot; products are vi@@ vid argu@@ ments about how we should live our lives . &quot;
this is another version of that . this is a sea dra@@ g@@ on , and the one on the bottom , the blue one , is a ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le that has not yet s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed the ac@@ id , has not yet taken in the brow@@ n-@@ green al@@ ga@@ e pon@@ d sc@@ um into its body to give it energy .
it means that , if you have t@@ .b. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be dete@@ cted , but will just die from t@@ .b. secon@@ dar@@ y infe@@ ctions and so on .
so as an adult , when i started to read about the amazing break@@ through@@ s with pen@@ ny patter@@ son and ko@@ ko , with sue sa@@ va@@ ge-@@ ru@@ m@@ bau@@ gh and kan@@ z@@ i , pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a , ir@@ ene pe@@ p@@ per@@ berg , ale@@ x the par@@ rot , i got all excited .
then , the idea is that wol@@ fra@@ m al@@ ph@@ a will be able to figure out what pre@@ cise pieces of code can do what they &apos;re asking for and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need to build up bigger and bigger , pre@@ cise programs .
what they remember is , of course , the great tri@@ um@@ ph , that the bri@@ ts were be@@ aten , and we won , and that the country was born .
we went to africa , sud@@ an , si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one , liber@@ ia , kenya .
and when i went back to research this , i realized that one of the great ted moments in the past , from na@@ than , we &apos;ve talked about an active tail .
in a small country that could be my country , but could be also your country , they took a decision -- it is a real case story -- that all of the govern@@ mental decisions , discus@@ sions of the coun@@ cil of mini@@ sters , were going to be published on the internet 24 hours after the coun@@ cil discus@@ sions took place .
el@@ on mus@@ k , i wish we had all day , but thank you so much for coming to ted .
and that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dy@@ ed , you know , that pe@@ cu@@ li@@ ar color of blue that mat@@ ches her pol@@ ye@@ ster pants suit , you know , same color as the bu@@ i@@ ck .
but it was quite obvious , quite clear , that for this particular rou@@ te that i had taken , the re@@ mot@@ er the school was , the worse its results seemed to be .
if we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world , we can go to the bo@@ li@@ vi@@ an edge of the ama@@ zon , here also in 197@@ 5 , and if you look really carefully , there &apos;s a thin white line through that kind of se@@ am , and there &apos;s a l@@ one farmer out there in the middle of the pri@@ me@@ val jung@@ le .
and so , i have my first slide to talk about the da@@ w@@ ning of the universe and what i call the co@@ s@@ mic scene investi@@ gation , that is , looking at the reli@@ cs of creation and in@@ fer@@ ring what happened at the beginning , and then following it up and trying to understand it .
and there , only there , you really feel that you are part of a larger thing or of a larger global ecosystem .
and i thought , no , it &apos;s a very inti@@ mate look , but it &apos;s not a look a daughter gives her father .
and within je@@ wish teach@@ ings , the rab@@ bin@@ ic teach@@ ings , we have hil@@ le@@ l , who taught that you shouldn &apos;t do to others what you don &apos;t like being done to yourself .
now , instead of doing it like mis@@ direction and thro@@ wing it off to the side , instead , what i choose to focus on is frank , to be able to play with the frank inside your head , your little security gu@@ ard , and get you , instead of foc@@ using on your ex@@ ternal senses , just to go intern@@ al for a second .
i mean , think about it : the care we take in sel@@ ec@@ ting sun@@ glas@@ ses , or je@@ wel@@ ry , or ac@@ cess@@ ories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong on your face .
the planning function and policy function sta@@ ys with the mini@@ stry ; the deli@@ very of services on the ground , you should use whatever works -- chur@@ ches , n@@ gos , local communities , whatever works .
hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton &apos;s kitchen . hun@@ t@@ ing@@ ton , where i made this program , you know , we &apos;ve got this pri@@ me@@ -@@ time program that hopefully will inspi@@ re people to really get on this change .
so you start really understanding that you can have diseases , tox@@ ins , a need to balance your diet , and once you start looking , and from that point on , everything i have done in terms of the consumption of information , the production of information , the prepar@@ ation of information , i &apos;ve looked at from the vie@@ w@@ point of food .
and the challenge with these kinds of algorith@@ mic fil@@ ters , these person@@ alized fil@@ ters , is that , because they &apos;re main@@ ly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
the green areas here show where cor@@ n y@@ i@@ el@@ ds , just showing cor@@ n as an example , are already really high , probably the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um you could find on earth today for that climate and soil , but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where we &apos;re only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the y@@ i@@ el@@ d you should be able to get .
that is great , that means we &apos;re going to have 10 billion minds working together , 10 billion tal@@ ents together .
the other piece of good news , for a scientist at least , is that much rema@@ ins to be discovered .
these population studies that we &apos;ve done have created tons of mira@@ cle drugs that have saved millions of lives , but the problem is that health care is tre@@ ating us as a@@ ver@@ ages , not unique individuals , because at the end of the day , the patient is not the same thing as the population who are studied . that &apos;s what &apos;s leading to the gu@@ ess@@ work .
it sounds good , but i &apos;ll bet you know in your gut that it &apos;s not the whole truth , and i &apos;ll tell you why .
well , the argument in &quot; the blan@@ k s@@ late &quot; was that eli@@ te art and cri@@ tic@@ ism in the 20th century , although not the arts in general , have dis@@ da@@ ined beauty , pleasure , c@@ lar@@ ity , insi@@ ght and style .
today , we use a single feed@@ stock , pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um , to heat our homes , power our cars and make most of the materials you see around you .
i had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
thanks . thank you . now , ju@@ g@@ gling can be a lot of fun ; play with sk@@ ill and play with space , play with rhyth@@ m .
but if we re@@ ar@@ range this for@@ mul@@ a quickly , we can get to acceler@@ ation equ@@ als force over mass , which means that for a larger partic@@ le -- a larger mass -- it requires more force to change its direction .
so when we want to learn whether a planet is habit@@ able , whether it might be am@@ en@@ able to life , we want to know not only how much total light it recei@@ ves and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-@@ energy radiation , the u@@ v and the x-@@ ra@@ ys that are created by its star and that ba@@ the it in this bat@@ h of high-@@ energy radiation .
the man , his name was ma@@ h@@ mou@@ d , and the child , whose name was ra@@ f@@ i , left .
and within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over@@ -@@ sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed lives .
and today , we have what is perhaps our most offen@@ sive definition , at least to me , which is the following : to do@@ od@@ le offi@@ cially means to da@@ w@@ d@@ le , to di@@ l@@ ly d@@ ally , to mon@@ key around , to make meaning@@ less mar@@ ks , to do something of little value , sub@@ stance or im@@ port , and -- my personal favorite -- to do nothing .
he wrote this to his love , mau@@ d gon@@ ne , and he was be@@ wa@@ il@@ ing the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed eth@@ ically , is start a human life from scrat@@ ch with alter@@ ed genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
now , i &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the mag@@ net &apos;s fall@@ ing , the greater the stopp@@ ing force .
the person on the assem@@ bly line doesn &apos;t know because he doesn &apos;t know how to dri@@ ll an oil well to get oil out to make plastic , and so on .
they &apos;re both made of carbon , and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it that are ar@@ ran@@ ged in one particular way -- on the left -- and you get graphi@@ te , which is soft and dark .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robo@@ tics competi@@ tions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
dou@@ g ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter wonder@@ s , well , maybe our intelligence just isn &apos;t great enough to understand our intelligence , and if we were smar@@ ter , well , then our brains would be that much more complicated , and we &apos;d never catch up to it .
now folks , this is not just a metaphor i &apos;m going to give you now , it &apos;s true .
but the people who fabri@@ cated that solar coo@@ ker are women , il@@ liter@@ ate women , who actually fabri@@ cate the most sophisti@@ cated solar coo@@ ker .
i &apos;m curious about how things work and how they are made , but also because i believe we should have a deeper understanding of the components that make up our world , and right now , we don &apos;t know enough about these high-@@ tech com@@ pos@@ ites our future will be made of .
imagine a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . but as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of h@@ 20 , water .
the master said , &apos; tho@@ u di@@ d@@ st thy best , that is success . &apos; &quot; from those things , and one other perhaps , i co@@ ined my own definition of success , which is : peace of mind at@@ tain@@ ed only through self-@@ satis@@ fac@@ tion in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you &apos;re capable .
so there has been a project which res@@ cu@@ es the dead sea by creating a pi@@ p@@ eline , a pi@@ pe , sometimes above the surface , sometimes bu@@ ried , that will red@@ ress that , and will feed from the gul@@ f of a@@ q@@ ab@@ a into the dead sea .
well , we collect data from satelli@@ tes , from air@@ planes , from ground vehi@@ cles , from people .
it &apos;s the process of creation that kee@@ ps me sort of a bubble and a half above per@@ pe@@ tual an@@ x@@ iety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fil@@ ls my entire life .
and so if something isn &apos;t standard , &quot; o@@ ops , du@@ mp@@ ster . &quot; &quot; o@@ ops &quot; this . &quot; o@@ ops , war@@ ped . &quot;
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
but if we could move char@@ it@@ able giving from two percent of g@@ dp up just one step to three percent of g@@ dp , by invest@@ ing in that growth , that would be an extra 150 billion dollars a year in contribu@@ tions , and if that money could go dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately to health and human services ch@@ ari@@ ties , because those were the ones we encoura@@ ged to invest in their growth , that would represent a tri@@ pl@@ ing of contribu@@ tions to that sector .
i don &apos;t know if you know this but -- maybe it &apos;s different now , or maybe you were making a stat@@ ement -- but in many hospital nur@@ series across the country , until very recently anyway , according to a book by j@@ essi@@ ca ben@@ jam@@ in , the sig@@ ns over the little boys cri@@ bs read , &quot; i &apos;m a boy , &quot; and the sig@@ ns over the little girls cri@@ bs read , &quot; it &apos;s a girl . &quot; yeah .
it turned out , as i think you could see in ai@@ mee &apos;s cap@@ abilities and at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , people with a desire to do something are quite remarkable and nature is quite adap@@ table .
using computers , even though they &apos;re getting faster and better all the time , it &apos;s a challenge to deal with gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of data , ter@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of data and extra@@ cting the relevant information .
you , yourself , will find yourself in a hospital bed -- or your mother , your child -- there are heads no@@ d@@ ding , people who say , &quot; yes , i know exactly what you mean . &quot;
and what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , progra@@ mm@@ ers , wri@@ ters , engineers , thin@@ kers -- that people really need long stre@@ t@@ ches of un@@ inter@@ rup@@ ted time to get something done .
i &apos;ve always been attra@@ cted to those rare people who pull that off , who de@@ vote their lives to humanity with the gr@@ it of the war@@ ri@@ or and the gra@@ ce of the my@@ stic -- people like martin lu@@ ther king , j@@ r . , who wrote , &quot; i can never be what i ought to be until you are what you ought to be .
new@@ ton a@@ du@@ ak@@ a : thank you . the first clip , really , is totally trying to capture what cin@@ em@@ a is for me , and where i &apos;m coming from in terms of cin@@ em@@ a .
and my favorite example of that occur@@ red beginning in 197@@ 6 , when it was discovered that the bacteria caus@@ ing legi@@ on@@ na@@ ires disease had always been present in natural wat@@ ers , but it was the pre@@ cise temperature of the water in he@@ ating , venti@@ l@@ ating and air condi@@ tion@@ ing systems that raised the right temperature for the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um re@@ production of legi@@ on@@ ell@@ a bac@@ ill@@ us .
i find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see dar@@ k@@ ness .
because they thought that if you are having a telescop@@ e , you are an astronom@@ er so what you are doing is actually looking in a telescop@@ e .
and when i was appl@@ ying to business school and felt certain i couldn &apos;t do it and nobody i knew had done it , i went to my a@@ unt who survi@@ ved years of be@@ at@@ ings at the hand of her husband and es@@ cap@@ ed a marriage of ab@@ use with only her dig@@ ni@@ ty in@@ t@@ act .
what this picture suggests to us is that we &apos;ve got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capit@@ alized . not that it &apos;s become less capital inten@@ sive -- that there &apos;s less money that &apos;s requi@@ red -- but that the ow@@ ner@@ ship of this capital , the way the capit@@ alization happens , is radi@@ cally distribu@@ ted . each of us , in these advanced econom@@ ies , has one of these , or something rather like it -- a computer .
there &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of du@@ bi@@ ous value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
it was everybody &apos;s pain . and then i knew , just like before , that i had a choice . i could keep fighting this or i could let go and accept not only my body but the circum@@ stances of my life .
it &apos;s just going to do a tiny bit of process@@ ing to conver@@ t that image that we just took into a sort of digital finger@@ print , and the great thing is , if you &apos;re a professional user , -- so , a newspaper -- the tools are pretty much iden@@ tical to what we &apos;ve just used to create this demon@@ stration .
it may be that the social sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity ahead is the one that we fear the most : a conver@@ gen@@ ce of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , of environmental de@@ gra@@ dation , of weapons of mass destruction , of pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , of poverty .
so there &apos;s a clear message : whether you care about a fundamental , basic research of really interesting , bizar@@ re , wonderful animals , or you want to build a se@@ arch@@ -@@ and-@@ res@@ cu@@ e robot that can help you in an earth@@ qua@@ ke , or to save someone in a fire , or you care about medicine , we must preser@@ ve nature &apos;s designs .
and then the third thing would be , please show me a s@@ hea@@ f of tex@@ ts written by 16@@ -year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ide@@ ally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could exam@@ ine this l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic mira@@ cle happening right under our no@@ ses .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaning@@ ful .
and you interact a lot with your neighb@@ ors -- people you like , people you might not know .
but i believe it can be done in a way that prote@@ cts our priv@@ acy , just like right now , when i look at your car from the outside , i don &apos;t really know about you .
and what ba@@ yes &apos; rule says is that i should multi@@ p@@ ly the numbers on the red by the numbers on the green to get the numbers of the yellow , which have the elli@@ p@@ ses , and that &apos;s my belief .
now , we &apos;re going to be going to mars one day . and when we do , it &apos;s going to be un@@ fair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridi@@ cul@@ ous names .
right ? so , when institutions are told they are ob@@ stac@@ les , and that there are other ways of co@@ ordin@@ ating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ bl@@ er-@@ ross st@@ ages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a f@@ at@@ al illness : den@@ ial , an@@ ger , bar@@ ga@@ ining , accep@@ tan@@ ce .
if you don &apos;t just want a queen , you can buy , actually , a three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ ka@@ ge of bees , which comes in the mail , and of course , the post@@ al office is always very concerned when they get , you know , your three-@@ po@@ und pac@@ k@@ ages of bees .
the public is losing faith in democracy , says british mp r@@ ory ste@@ wart . iraq and afghanistan &apos;s new democra@@ cies are deeply cor@@ ru@@ pt ; mean@@ while , 8@@ 4 percent of people in britain say politics is broken . in this important talk , ste@@ wart sounds a call to action to re@@ build democracy , starting with recogni@@ zing why democracy is important -- not as a tool , but as an ide@@ al .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
we believe that in a one-@@ hour flight we can re@@ write the text@@ book on mars by making high-@@ resol@@ ution measu@@ re@@ ments of the atmosphere , looking for g@@ ases of bio@@ gen@@ ic orig@@ in , looking for g@@ ases of vol@@ can@@ ic orig@@ in , studying the surface , studying the magne@@ tis@@ m on the surface , which we don &apos;t understand , as well as about a do@@ zen other areas .
you can see , even though the u.s. is still the majority here -- though , by the way , se@@ arch@@ -@@ wise , it &apos;s only about 30 percent of our traffic -- but it &apos;s already going to japan , and the u.k. , and europe , and all the rest of the countries .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , in@@ sur@@ ance companies , us , started accoun@@ ting for the power of that hope .
we really felt like what we went in expe@@ cting had nothing to do with what we were actually experi@@ en@@ cing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
the one thing we have , which makes us so different from chimpanze@@ es or other living creatures , is this sophisti@@ cated spo@@ ken language -- a language with which we can tell children about things that aren &apos;t here .
and i think that as we look at culture , we kind of come to understand how we got to where we are .
and they would just st@@ are at us with ba@@ ff@@ le@@ ment when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance , like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid mov@@ ements , and they would be really ir@@ ri@@ t@@ ated and wouldn &apos;t see what we were up to .
so two minutes lead to these hor@@ mon@@ al changes that con@@ figure your brain to basically be either as@@ ser@@ tive , confi@@ dent and comfortable , or really st@@ res@@ s-@@ re@@ active , and , you know , feeling sort of shu@@ t down . and we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
i &apos;d like to show you thing called s@@ n@@ out , which is -- the idea behind this project is to make a robot that appe@@ ars as if it &apos;s contin@@ ually surprised to see you .
she introduced them to a book about the southern life that they had left behind : &quot; they sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of par@@ ad@@ ise was re@@ ga@@ ined . &quot;
th@@ us , even though every civili@@ an killed , ma@@ im@@ ed , ra@@ ped , or tor@@ tured is one too many , the fact that the number of civili@@ an cas@@ u@@ al@@ ties is clearly lower today than it was a decade ago , is good news .
one of the ways in which we would like to deal with the sophisti@@ cation of the modern world is through politics , and sa@@ dly you can have human@@ e moral principles , you can classi@@ fy , you can use lo@@ gic on abstra@@ ctions , and if you &apos;re ignor@@ ant of history and of other countries , you can &apos;t do politics .
it &apos;s almost like if a person has multiple diseases , it &apos;s hard to get well , you might die , but if you only have one disease to deal with , you can get better .
now that was che@@ ating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be am@@ y the hurt five year-old little sister , but am@@ y the special un@@ ic@@ or@@ n .
we need to spend more time appreci@@ ating what already exists , and less time ag@@ oni@@ zing over what else we can do .
is it the ex@@ pos@@ ure ? we have profess@@ ors from mit , ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , stanford , indian institute of science who come and teach our children lots of scientific for@@ mul@@ as , experiments , much beyond the classroom .
and the oceans are so productive , there &apos;s so much going on in there that &apos;s of relev@@ ance to humans that we really need to , even from a sel@@ fish perspective , try to do better than we have in the past .
so , practice compassion , read the char@@ ter , dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate it and develop it within yourself .
for me , this means that they &apos;re seeing the value of difference , the joy it brings when instead of foc@@ using on loss or limit@@ ation , we see and discover the power and joy of seeing the world from exciting new perspe@@ c@@ tives .
and just like that , i went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
and that &apos;s one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about , and , in general , i think it &apos;s the under@@ lying reason that it &apos;s been poli@@ tically un@@ accep@@ table to talk about this .
and not only is it em@@ power@@ ing to the communities , but really importantly , this information sta@@ ys in the community where it is needed to for@@ mu@@ late long-term health poli@@ ces .
stran@@ gen@@ ess is that c@@ ali@@ bra@@ tion of clo@@ sen@@ ess and distance that en@@ ables me to find the people that i need right now , that en@@ ables me to find the sources of inti@@ ma@@ cy , of discovery , and of inspiration that i need right now .
i &apos;ve travel@@ ed , as i said , to many , many countries , and i &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horri@@ fic to think what we do to girls in the world .
we need to make them proud of being a farmer because they allow us to survive .
and if you find yourself worried that something like a guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed income is going to stif@@ le our drive to succe@@ ed and make us kind of com@@ plac@@ ent , you might be interested to know that social mo@@ bility , one of the things we really pri@@ de ourselves on in the united states , is now lower than it is in the northern european countries that have these very gener@@ ous social safety nets .
the people in the modern world , in the se@@ cular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher sou@@ l-@@ like concern@@ s , tend to be isol@@ ated individuals .
and we have pl@@ ent@@ y of energy , so we &apos;ll solve that problem , but the biology problem &apos;s tri@@ cky , because as we put through all these tox@@ ic materials that we dis@@ gor@@ ge , we will never be able to re@@ cover that .
now , i was taken by in@@ spec@@ tor brian can@@ ter@@ a , of the ro@@ y@@ al can@@ adi@@ an moun@@ ted police , to a ca@@ vern@@ ous war@@ e@@ house east of van@@ cou@@ ver to see some of the goods which are regul@@ arly con@@ fis@@ cated by the r@@ c@@ mp from the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers who are sending it , of course , down south to the united states where there is an in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able market for b@@ .@@ c. bu@@ d , as it &apos;s called , in part because it &apos;s market@@ ed as organic , which of course goes down very well in california .
there are now do@@ zens , perhaps hundreds of studies showing that if you believe you &apos;re drin@@ king the expensive stuff , it ta@@ stes better to you .
so the management of electro@@ lu@@ x took our pi@@ le , our list of in@@ centi@@ ves , and they went outside the room for 17 minutes , and they came back in and they said , &quot; wow , this is the most gener@@ ous any community has ever been to try to keep jobs here .
well , because it gives them good , paying jobs , or , in many african countries , un@@ offi@@ cial opportunities to profit from corruption .
and they &apos;re literally saying , &quot; hey , this is nice , but ... &quot; like that focus graph , a lot of the teachers said , &quot; i have a feeling that a lot of the kids are jum@@ ping around and not foc@@ using on one top@@ ic . &quot;
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing , and i said , &quot; i could do that . &quot;
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a fro@@ g ; after , we become a mon@@ key ; after , we become what we are today : a super@@ -@@ mon@@ key , and the fun is , the super@@ -@@ mon@@ key we are today , is at half of the story .
it would be bad if we tried to fire our rock@@ ets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can es@@ cape .
probably not , right ? you want the person who &apos;s powerful and as@@ ser@@ tive and domin@@ ant , but not very stress re@@ active , the person who &apos;s la@@ id back .
by any economic standard , the demand for art of all forms is sky@@ rock@@ eting , as you can tell from the price of oper@@ a ti@@ ckets , by the number of books sold , by the number of books published , the number of musical ti@@ tles rele@@ ased , the number of new al@@ bu@@ ms and so on .
never have we seen , in the past 50 years , such a shar@@ p dec@@ line of ecosystem fun@@ ctions and services on the planet , one of them being the ability to regu@@ late climate on the long term , in our fore@@ sts , land and bio@@ diversity .
complexity is the problem that any theory of biology has to solve , and you can &apos;t solve it by post@@ ul@@ ating an ag@@ ent that is even more complex , there@@ by simply com@@ po@@ unding the problem .
this is a paper form , and what you &apos;re looking at is a paper form in the hand of a mini@@ stry of health nur@@ se in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia who is tra@@ mp@@ ing out across the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia on , i &apos;m sure , a very hot and hu@@ mi@@ d day , and she is going to be kno@@ cking on thousands of do@@ ors over a period of weeks or months , kno@@ cking on the do@@ ors and saying , &quot; exc@@ use me , we &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
and into the slow , second movement , mar@@ ked &quot; ada@@ gi@@ o religi@@ o@@ so , &quot; he in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated the sounds of bir@@ d@@ song that he heard outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring ; he was imag@@ ining a future for her in which he would play no part .
it &apos;s really too bor@@ ing whether you feel like this or like that , or what , you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel , by the way , the worse it gets .
if we &apos;d evolved in a vac@@ u@@ um , we would expect them to hit the ground simul@@ tane@@ ously . if we were bacteria , constantly bu@@ ff@@ et@@ ed by ther@@ mal mov@@ ements of molecules , it would be different , but we middle worl@@ ders are too big to notice brow@@ ni@@ an motion .
now i bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that i haven &apos;t even heard of , i &apos;m absolutely sure .
if nothing else works for you , get a dog . don &apos;t get a c@@ at . get a dog , because if you leave for two minutes , it &apos;s like you &apos;ve been gone for six months when you show back up again five minutes later , right ?
today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , not only the sha@@ w and strat@@ ford festi@@ v@@ als , but by the cor@@ ner@@ stone theater of los angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the ba@@ hi@@ a , the ca@@ tho@@ lic , the musli@@ m , the je@@ wish , even the na@@ tive american and the gay and les@@ bi@@ an communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explor@@ ed the differences in their faith and found common@@ ality as an important first step toward cros@@ s-@@ community heal@@ ing .
so , despite the fact that i &apos;m going to talk to you about an object that &apos;s super@@ massive , and i &apos;m going to get to what that really means in a moment , it has no fin@@ ite size .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipu@@ lations , you put it on a little device , the device fil@@ ters out the blood cells , lets the ser@@ um go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
these projects are so -- pa@@ yp@@ al , solar@@ city , tes@@ la , spac@@ e@@ x , they &apos;re so spec@@ tac@@ ul@@ arly different , they &apos;re such ambi@@ tious projects at scale .
when we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic we heard in the media .
we were fre@@ a@@ ks -- lo@@ b@@ ster cla@@ w boys and be@@ ar@@ ded ladies , od@@ di@@ ties ju@@ g@@ gling depression and lon@@ el@@ iness , playing soli@@ ta@@ ire , sp@@ in the bottle , trying to k@@ is@@ s the wo@@ unded parts of ourselves and he@@ al , but at night , while the others sle@@ pt , we kept walking the ti@@ gh@@ tro@@ pe .
their stories were so horri@@ fic , and so min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , i was sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
because as that happens , i think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
and ultimately i feel that in the same way that we test fl@@ am@@ e-@@ re@@ tar@@ d@@ ant pa@@ jam@@ as in an in@@ fer@@ no to en@@ sure they won &apos;t catch fire when our child reach@@ es across the sto@@ ve , so these stories of families negoti@@ ating these extreme differences refle@@ ct on the universal experience of par@@ enting , which is always that sometimes you look at your child and you think , where did you come from ?
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a lo@@ aner , but i did go into the manhattan sho@@ w@@ room of the manufac@@ tur@@ er , to@@ to , and they have a ba@@ th@@ room off of the sho@@ w@@ room that you can use , which i used .
now the good news is that the od@@ ds of it actually pas@@ sing through this key@@ hole and hit@@ ting us next go@@ -@@ around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low od@@ ds , so i personally am not lying a@@ wake at night wor@@ rying about this at all .
but if i was to say that they &apos;re both examples of alternative or new forms of cur@@ ren@@ cy in a hyper@@ connected , dat@@ a-@@ driven global economy , you &apos;d probably think i was a little bit bon@@ kers .
i think it &apos;s very important , because right now somebody needs to step up , and this generation of veter@@ ans has the opportunity to do that if they are given the chance .
we know what it &apos;s like to have these people on tv , in con@@ gress , y@@ elling about how the end of the world is coming if we don &apos;t adop@@ t their view completely , because it &apos;s happened about the dollar ever since there &apos;s been a dollar .
then we get a little bit more serious , so we have what we call our c@@ ad / cam@@ s and all the engineers who are involved , or scientists who are involved , who know about ther@@ mal properties , know about design , know about atmosp@@ her@@ ic interaction , par@@ ach@@ utes , all of these things , which they work in a team effort and actually design a spac@@ ec@@ raft in a computer to some ex@@ tent , so to see , does that meet the requi@@ re@@ ment that we need .
the best thing we can do is figure out ways to nur@@ ture the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al spirit and the tremendous un@@ ta@@ pped potential in our pris@@ ons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
instead , all the major thre@@ ats facing us today are problems entirely of our own making . and since we made the problems , we can also solve the problems . that then means that it &apos;s entirely in our power to deal with these problems .
if we can break down this sort of divi@@ de , this un@@ e@@ ase , this ten@@ sion , this sense that we &apos;re not fundament@@ ally collabor@@ ating here in driving these social problems , we can break this down , and we finally , i think , can have solutions .
you know , i am so bad at tech that my daughter -- who is now 4@@ 1 -- when she was five , was over@@ heard by me to say to a friend of her@@ s , if it doesn &apos;t ble@@ ed when you cut it , my da@@ d@@ dy doesn &apos;t understand it .
so , if we want to track something that was spre@@ ading through a network , what we ide@@ ally would like to do is to set up sensor@@ s on the central individuals within the network , including no@@ de a , monit@@ or those people that are right there in the middle of the network , and somehow get an early dete@@ ction of whatever it is that is spre@@ ading through the network .
now , darwin taught us that there are processes of self-@@ organization that suff@@ ice to explain all of us and everything we see .
a con@@ gol@@ ese woman , who was telling me about how her children saw their father killed in front of them and saw her ra@@ ped in front of them and mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated in front of them , and her children saw their nin@@ e-@@ year-old si@@ bling killed in front of them , how they &apos;re doing okay right now .
yeah , yeah , back to the corner , back to the corner .
right about the time that the internet gets going as an edu@@ cational tool , i take off from wis@@ con@@ sin and move to kan@@ s@@ as , small town kan@@ s@@ as , where i had an opportunity to teach in a lo@@ vely , small@@ -@@ town , rural kan@@ s@@ as school distri@@ ct , where i was teaching my favorite subject , american government .
anyway , so i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing that an alternative primary education , whatever alternative you want , is requi@@ red where schools don &apos;t exist , where schools are not good enough , where teachers are not available or where teachers are not good enough , for whatever reason .
and now let me become less sen@@ ti@@ mental , and say that saving lives -- which some of the aid we get does on this continent -- when you save the life of anyone , a farmer , a teacher , a mother , they are contribu@@ ting produ@@ c@@ tively into the economy .
you see ban@@ ks -- i don &apos;t know if there are any bank@@ ers over here ; i apo@@ logi@@ ze in ad@@ v@@ ance -- but it &apos;s the best job in the world .
why ? because we know what you have , and we know how to treat it -- although we can &apos;t make v@@ acc@@ ine in this country , but that &apos;s a different story .
but i think this research shows that the british en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , or the scot@@ tish en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , with david hu@@ me , adam smith , actually had a better hand@@ le on who we are -- that reason is often we@@ ak , our sen@@ ti@@ ments are strong , and our sen@@ ti@@ ments are often tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy .
in 197@@ 6 , for example , government and industry insi@@ sted that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of g@@ dp could never go down .
and it exc@@ ites me now to meet people who are hi@@ kers , che@@ fs , code wri@@ ters , tax@@ i dri@@ vers , people i never would have gu@@ essed who loved the music and who are pas@@ sing it on .
it &apos;s by giving away what you think is your deep@@ est secret that maybe millions of people are em@@ powered to help improve it .
and yet , in many places , a third of the children , by the time they &apos;re three already are facing a life of hard@@ ship due to this .
but since we ate all the o@@ y@@ sters and we ate all the fish that would eat the plan@@ k@@ ton , there &apos;s nothing to eat the plan@@ k@@ ton and there &apos;s more and more of it , so it dies of old age , which is un@@ heard of for plan@@ k@@ ton .
i think that the &quot; now ti@@ ed up , ti@@ ed down , mi@@ stress cru@@ el approach@@ es me , now ti@@ ed down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
he recor@@ ds a song called &quot; blind will@@ ie mc@@ tell , &quot; named after the blu@@ es sing@@ er , and the song is a vo@@ y@@ age through the past , through a much dar@@ ker time , but a simpl@@ er one , a time when musi@@ cians like will@@ ie mc@@ tell had few illu@@ sions about what they did .
sure , it is involved in positive emotions like love and compassion , but it &apos;s also involved in tons of other processes , like memory , language , attention , even an@@ ger , dis@@ g@@ ust and pain .
so , anyway , thank you so much for le@@ tting me speak .
so i think maybe ted , you impact people &apos;s lives in the ways maybe even you don &apos;t realize .
so i &apos;m going to brie@@ fly disc@@ uss a couple of problems that we have and a couple of problems where we &apos;ve got some solutions under@@ way .
but it does make a point -- which is one which , in a sense , differ@@ enti@@ ates the real world of people who make things , and the world of people who think about things , which is , there is an intellectual mer@@ it to asking : how do we make things as simple as we can , as cheap as we can , as func@@ tional as we can and as fre@@ ely inter@@ connec@@ table as we can ?
but i think this is the fru@@ stration that perhaps a lot people have , like people in the audience here , where we love the kind of language that you &apos;re talking about .
i believe in speci@@ fi@@ cs , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of story , and the past , the speci@@ fi@@ cs of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
i tell kids when they struggle through some u@@ ph@@ ill and feel like they cannot take it anymore , it really helps to ignor@@ e the immedi@@ ate ob@@ stac@@ les and raise your head and look around and see how the vi@@ st@@ a around you gro@@ ws .
you know , audi@@ ences like you , yeah , make the event .
sam har@@ r@@ is : yeah , well i think i tried to bro@@ ach this in a sentence , watching the clock ti@@ cking , but the question is : what is volun@@ t@@ ary in a context where men have certain expec@@ tations , and you &apos;re guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t v@@ eil yourself ?
and i thought she &apos;d say , &quot; oh , you know , up the la@@ go@@ on somewhere , or maybe across africa , &quot; but you &apos;ll be happy to know she said it came from here , it comes from the north sea .
but i knew what he meant , because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures of flo@@ wers in a garden and then , basically , inde@@ x them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn &apos;t .
what if we had a waiting room where you don &apos;t just sit when you &apos;re sick , but where you go to get healthy .
even though sometimes watching television about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow , but that &apos;s when you choose a program you really want to watch and you get feedback from it .
the tun@@ a team from top@@ p has done the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able : three teams tag@@ ged 1,@@ 700 tun@@ as , blu@@ ef@@ in , yel@@ lo@@ w@@ f@@ in and al@@ bac@@ ore all at the same time -- carefully re@@ he@@ ar@@ sed tag@@ ging programs in which we go out , pick up ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le tun@@ as , put in the ta@@ gs that actually have the sensor@@ s , stick out the tun@@ a and then let them go .
and hold it there , hold it there , both of you , hold it there .
it &apos;s almost as if that stimul@@ us , you , you &apos;re not exer@@ ting influence on what happens as they navi@@ gate their daily lives .
in this case , instead of thro@@ wing che@@ wing g@@ um , or dor@@ it@@ os or whatever you have in your po@@ cket at the fish -- there &apos;s a body of water in ic@@ eland that i &apos;ve been dealing with that &apos;s in the middle of the city , and the largest pollution bur@@ den on it is not the ro@@ ad@@ bor@@ ne pollution , it &apos;s actually white bread from people fe@@ eding the fish and the birds .
ven@@ ice is sin@@ king . to save it , ra@@ ch@@ el arm@@ strong says we need to out@@ grow architecture made of in@@ ert materials and , well , make architecture that gro@@ ws itself . she pro@@ pos@@ es a not@@ -@@ qu@@ it@@ e-@@ alive material that does its own re@@ pa@@ irs and sequ@@ est@@ ers carbon , too .
they were working on truly global products , and companies like microsoft , google , a@@ stra@@ zen@@ ec@@ a , general electric , phili@@ ps , have already ans@@ wer@@ ed in the aff@@ ir@@ ma@@ tive the question that from their bang@@ al@@ ore and hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad r &amp; amp ; d centers they are able to produce products and services for the world .
through haiti re@@ wired , through build change , architecture for humanity , ai@@ d@@ g , there is the possibility to reach out to 3@@ 0,000 -- 4@@ 0,000 ma@@ sons across the country and create a movement of pro@@ per building .
and this exhi@@ bi@@ tion is about the work of designers that help us be more el@@ a@@ stic , and also of designers that really work on this el@@ a@@ sti@@ city as an opportunity . and one last thing is that it &apos;s not only designers , but it &apos;s also scientists .
of course , as soon as you say something like this people say it is impossible , and that &apos;s what was said by su@@ zu@@ ki .
and sometimes it takes a wa@@ ke@@ -up call , doesn &apos;t it , to al@@ ert us to the fact that we &apos;re hur@@ rying through our lives , instead of actually living them ; that we &apos;re living the fast life , instead of the good life .
so here we were , a nuclear physi@@ c@@ ist , an intern@@ ist , soon jo@@ ined by car@@ r@@ ie hr@@ us@@ ka , a bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal engineer , and two radi@@ ologists , and we were trying to take on the ent@@ ren@@ ched world of mammo@@ graph@@ y with a machine that was held together by du@@ ct ta@@ pe .
de@@ an or@@ nis@@ h shares new research that shows how adop@@ ting healthy lifest@@ yle hab@@ its can affect a person at a genetic level . for instance , he says , when you live heal@@ thi@@ er , eat better , exercise , and love more , your brain cells actually increase .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other ma@@ mm@@ als , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ g@@ aro@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexi@@ ble they are .
and with the same do@@ g@@ ged determin@@ ation that my father had b@@ red into me since i was such a child -- he taught me how to sa@@ il , knowing i could never see where i was going , i could never see the sh@@ ore , and i couldn &apos;t see the sa@@ ils , and i couldn &apos;t see the dest@@ ination .
you bring your water , you bring your so@@ ap , i was@@ h the clo@@ th@@ es for you . charge 50 pa@@ is@@ a , one ru@@ pe@@ e for you per lot , and a new business model can emer@@ ge .
and i also hope that you share the idea that if engineers and designers can use all these different cli@@ matic par@@ am@@ e@@ ters , it will be possible to create really good and comfortable out@@ door conditions , to change our ther@@ mal perception that we feel comfortable in an out@@ door environment , and we can do that with the best passi@@ ve design , but also using the energy source of the site in q@@ at@@ ar which is the sun .
they &apos;ll be cooking , cle@@ an@@ ing , buying things , sh@@ opp@@ ing , building . but they aren &apos;t here .
and some are quite struc@@ tural , like social impact bon@@ ds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting teen@@ a@@ gers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
what we do is we sit and teach our kids all the things they shouldn &apos;t do : don &apos;t hit ; don &apos;t bi@@ te ; don &apos;t swe@@ ar .
when the paper bur@@ ned , for some reason he turned to me , and he said , &quot; ma@@ shel@@ k@@ ar , like this , if you do not diff@@ use your energi@@ es , if you focus your energi@@ es , you can achieve anything in the world . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to take you through , perhaps push you a little bit mathema@@ tically -- so bra@@ ce y@@ ourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works , which en@@ ables us to capture what is symme@@ try .
they turned a chair from something the pur@@ ch@@ asing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
and he said , &quot; i hope that you will have the strength to do what i did .
we had fashion designers , instal@@ lation artists , models , we had ma@@ ke@@ up artists , je@@ wel@@ ry designers , all kinds of people working with me to make my we@@ d@@ ding an art instal@@ lation .
what we &apos;re going to try and do today , in the 16 and a bit minutes i &apos;ve got left , is to try and answer three questions . the first one is , why ?
whi@@ che@@ ver way they want to do it , of their own vo@@ li@@ tion , they &apos;re trying to make their own lives differently , and worldwide , we &apos;ve got communities across america and japan -- it &apos;s incredible , isn &apos;t it ? i mean , america and japan and new ze@@ al@@ and .
now you may not think of hot@@ mail as being mira@@ cul@@ ous , but for me it was mira@@ cul@@ ous , because i noticed , just as i was w@@ rest@@ ling with this problem , i was working in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa mostly at the time .
she was a single woman about to go alone into a country , not even speaking the language , to travel alone by bus and boat to go to a beach she did not know or had never seen .
so this is called st@@ il@@ ting . it &apos;s a ther@@ mal behavior that you and i do if we cross the beach , we jump onto a to@@ we@@ l , somebody has this to@@ we@@ l -- &quot; sorry , i &apos;ve jum@@ ped onto your to@@ we@@ l . &quot; -- and then you sc@@ u@@ ttle across onto somebody else &apos;s to@@ we@@ l , and that way you don &apos;t burn your feet .
we launched two ti@@ tles in oc@@ tober -- &quot; rock@@ et@@ t &apos;s new school &quot; -- the first of a series of products -- is about a character called rock@@ et@@ t beginning her first day of school in ei@@ gh@@ th grade at a brand new place , with a blan@@ k s@@ late , which allows girls to play with the question of , &quot; what will i be like when i &apos;m older ? &quot;
once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a c@@ age with a hole , and actually the animal lear@@ ns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target sc@@ ent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
&apos;@@ okay . small . fire on ice . tell them not to kill me .
because if they to@@ xi@@ fy themselves , being the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost produ@@ cer , send it to the lo@@ west@@ -@@ cost distribution -- wal@@ -@@ m@@ art -- and then we send them all our money , what we &apos;ll discover is that we have what , effectively , when i was a student , was called mu@@ tu@@ ally assu@@ red destruction .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and myster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know .
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
and we also needed to make sure that we could take bra@@ d &apos;s i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cr@@ as@@ ies , his little tics , the little sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties that make him who he is and have that trans@@ late through our process so that it appe@@ ars in ben@@ jam@@ in on the screen .
let &apos;s talk about how we can use digital technology , the technology of our dreams , to make this life the life we can love .
and this bone is pe@@ p@@ per@@ ed , as you can see , with the light sh@@ ining through the sk@@ ul@@ l with ca@@ vi@@ ties , the sin@@ uses , which warm and mo@@ i@@ sten the air we brea@@ the .
and we did , and we travel@@ ed around , and we spoke to el@@ ders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nur@@ ses , we held press con@@ fer@@ ences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with is@@ a@@ f , we sat down with na@@ to , we sat down with the u.k. government .
and it &apos;s this combin@@ ation , this cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive technology , that intri@@ gues me , because i think it &apos;s the secret to understanding what &apos;s happening in the world .
ro@@ b for@@ bes , the fo@@ under of design within reach , shows a g@@ aller@@ y of s@@ nap@@ sh@@ ots that in@@ form his way of seeing the world . char@@ ming ju@@ x@@ ta@@ posi@@ tions , found art , urban patterns -- this sli@@ des@@ how will open your eyes to the world around you .
i think politicians can help fo@@ ster non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum relationships , economic engagement is generally better than block@@ a@@ des and so on , in this reg@@ ard .
so the work of innovation , the work of coming up with new ideas , is some of the most powerful , some of the most fundamental work that we can do in an economy . and this is kind of how we used to do innovation .
these people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area , and i think it &apos;s a lot better than they put it in an area of a better cell phone or something -- but they &apos;re putting it in very -- areas and this will lead us into this kind of cap@@ ability , and it will lead us into the next really big thing and it will allow us to explore . and i think eventually it will allow us to col@@ oni@@ ze and to keep us from going extin@@ ct .
so since we can make some interesting proto@@ cells that we like , interesting colors and interesting behaviors , and they &apos;re very easy to make , and they have interesting life@@ like properties , perhaps these proto@@ cells have something to tell us about the orig@@ in of life on the earth . perhaps these represent an easily acc@@ essi@@ ble step , one of the first steps by which life got started on the early earth .
and what happened was we started creating these fan@@ cy c@@ us@@ hi@@ oned things , which can make running &quot; better , &quot; called running shoes .
but we move to cities , toward the bright lights , and one of the things that is there that we want , bes@@ i@@ des jobs , is electricity .
evolution &apos;s the same thing . we taught our kids , well , the bi@@ ble says , you know , god created all these species , cat@@ s are cat@@ s , dogs are dogs , people are people , plants are plants , they don &apos;t change .
so in many cases this is not so much about making change as it is creating the conditions under which change is possible and the in@@ cen@@ tive to want to make change , which is easier said than done in rural communities and in insi@@ de-@@ the-@@ box education systems in rural communities .
you show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; i un@@ lo@@ aded the dis@@ h@@ was@@ her , &quot; but he really li@@ stens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- i &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be inter@@ active with the patient , where they see the video and they &apos;re being video@@ ed and they press , do you understand this ? no , i don &apos;t .
and in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that c@@ lon@@ ing is possible , and that invol@@ ves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
there is another thing with those tra@@ its that we so easily obser@@ ve in each other that i think is wor@@ th@@ while to consider , and that is that , in a very liter@@ al sense , they &apos;re really on the surface of our bodies .
this looks like a series of breaking waves , and it &apos;s caused by she@@ aring win@@ ds -- the wind above the cloud layer and below the cloud layer diff@@ er signific@@ antly , and in the middle , in between , you get this und@@ ul@@ ating of the air , and if the difference in those spee@@ ds is just right , the tops of the un@@ du@@ lations cur@@ l over in these beautiful breaking wa@@ ve-@@ like vor@@ tic@@ es .
you &apos;re seeing an anima@@ tion that goes between an example of what you would see if you don &apos;t use this techni@@ que -- in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cen@@ ter@@ ed on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
and we were gr@@ ate@@ ful that i was able to get preg@@ nant , and i soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when i was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
sam@@ u@@ el p@@ is@@ ar , an au@@ schwi@@ tz survi@@ vor , said , and i &apos;ll quote him , &quot; the h@@ olo@@ cau@@ st teach@@ es us that nature , even in its cru@@ el@@ est moments , is ben@@ ig@@ n in compar@@ ison with man , when he lo@@ ses his moral comp@@ ass and his reason . &quot;
we couldn &apos;t believe that it could do this . it said to us that if you could build a robot with very simple , spr@@ ing@@ y legs , you could make it as man@@ eu@@ ver@@ able as any that &apos;s ever been built .
but i think if you cut through those forces , you get to what might be the deeper driver , the nu@@ b of the question , which is how we think about time itself .
and it &apos;s led to a view of human nature that we &apos;re rational individuals who respond in stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward ways to in@@ centi@@ ves , and it &apos;s led to ways of seeing the world where people try to use the assu@@ mp@@ tions of physics to measure how human behavior is .
finally , in about the six@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , a physi@@ cian whose name was the@@ op@@ h@@ ra@@ st@@ us bom@@ ba@@ st@@ us au@@ re@@ ol@@ us von ho@@ hen@@ heim , called par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s , a name probably familiar to some people here -- -- good , old par@@ ac@@ el@@ su@@ s found that he could predict the degree of con@@ vul@@ sion by using a measu@@ red amount of cam@@ ph@@ or to produce the con@@ vul@@ sion .
and when you think about the economy through these two different len@@ ses , you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve , because the worse the crisis gets , the higher the sta@@ kes are , the more each side thinks they know the answer and the other side is just going to ru@@ in everything .
so l@@ ul@@ a , he &apos;s full of problems , full of con@@ tradi@@ ctions , but one of the things that he &apos;s doing is , he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international rela@@ tions that completely shif@@ ts the balance from the standard sort of nor@@ th-@@ south dialo@@ gue into a whole new way of global collaboration .
if i could reve@@ al anything that is hidden from us , at least in modern cultures , it would be to reve@@ al something that we &apos;ve for@@ gotten , that we used to know as well as we knew our own names .
you start with some water , po@@ ur in some nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , add anti@@ bodies , mix it up , take some paper , di@@ p it , dry it , and you can dete@@ ct cancer .
&quot; i love how they were able to preser@@ ve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- bu@@ tter@@ flies , man@@ -@@ made fore@@ sts , li@@ me@@ stone ca@@ ves and hey , even a huge py@@ th@@ on . &quot;
so , what people were saying to me about the cause of cancer , sources of cancer , or , for that matter , why you are who you are , didn &apos;t make sense .
we &apos;re going to have to re-@@ learn what the building blocks of these things are : the street , the block , how to com@@ pose public space that &apos;s both large and small , the cour@@ ty@@ ard , the ci@@ vi@@ c square and how to really make use of this property .
and , yeah , we can look back in retro@@ spe@@ ct and say , yeah , ha@@ -@@ ha , you know -- it &apos;s all micro@@ film . but that &apos;s -- that &apos;s not the point . he understood the shape of the future .
i didn &apos;t have an ex@@ act address , but i knew his name , ab@@ ed , i knew that he lived in a town of 15@@ ,000 , k@@ far kar@@ a , and i knew that , 21 years before , just outside this hol@@ y city , he broke my ne@@ ck .
the third thing on my che@@ ck@@ list is rela@@ tions with neighbor@@ ing friend@@ ly societies that may pro@@ p up a society . and if that friend@@ ly support is pulled away , that may make a society more likely to collapse . in the case of the green@@ land nor@@ se , they had trade with the mother country -- nor@@ way -- and that trade d@@ wind@@ led : par@@ tly because nor@@ way got we@@ ak@@ er , par@@ tly because of sea ice between green@@ land and nor@@ way .
it can be a school of design in jer@@ us@@ al@@ em that tries to find a better way to design gas mas@@ ks for people , because , as you know , israel de@@ plo@@ ys one gas mas@@ k per person including babies .
you know that what you need to do is possible to do , even though difficult , and sense of time disappe@@ ars , you forget yourself , you feel part of something larger .
i used the shi@@ pping contain@@ er and also the students helped us to make all the building fur@@ ni@@ ture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
the fuel , like i said , is cer@@ am@@ ic inside zir@@ con@@ ium fuel ro@@ ds , and in the event of an accident in one of these type of re@@ ac@@ tors , fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and three mile island -- looking back at three mile island , we didn &apos;t really see this for a while â but these zir@@ con@@ ium cla@@ dd@@ ings on these fuel ro@@ ds , what happens is , when they see high pressure water , ste@@ am , in an o@@ xi@@ di@@ zing environment , they &apos;ll actually produce hydro@@ gen , and that hydro@@ gen has this explo@@ sive cap@@ ability to rele@@ ase fis@@ sion products .
sum@@ mer@@ time and the living is easy fish are jum@@ ping and the c@@ ot@@ ton is high oh , your da@@ d@@ dy &apos;s rich and your ma is goo@@ d-@@ looking so hus@@ h little baby don &apos;t you c@@ ry and i opened my eyes , and i saw that she had her eyes closed .
and i think the reason it has a sting is because thousands of years of history don &apos;t rever@@ se themselves without a lot of pain , and that &apos;s why i talk about us all going through this together .
the red dots you see up there are sites that are behavi@@ oral tracking that i have not navi@@ g@@ ated to , but are following me .
but it is , unlike cars , which have developed so rapi@@ dly and or@@ der@@ ly , actually the school system is recogni@@ z@@ ably an in@@ her@@ it@@ ance from the 19@@ th century , from a bis@@ marki@@ an model of ger@@ man scho@@ ol@@ ing that got taken up by english re@@ form@@ ers , and often by religious mis@@ sion@@ aries , taken up in the united states as a force of social co@@ h@@ es@@ i@@ on , and then in japan and south korea as they developed .
so first , if you are the type , like the shir@@ t@@ less dan@@ cing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nur@@ turing your first few follo@@ wers as equ@@ als so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
i &apos;m fascin@@ ated with the idea of what happens when you mer@@ ge biology with technology , and i remember reading about this idea of being able to re@@ program biology , in the future , away from disease and aging .
and like a living organis@@ m , you te@@ ar it open , it ble@@ e@@ ds its mol@@ ten blood , ris@@ es up to he@@ al that wo@@ und from the as@@ th@@ en@@ o@@ sphere , har@@ dens , forms new tissue and moves lat@@ er@@ ally .
but if you look into the eye of consciousness , that single eye you can see , i &apos;m looking down , but let me tell you how i felt at that point .
but i put it to you that if the united states and european countries want to re@@ main glob@@ ally influ@@ enti@@ al , they may have to consider co@@ operating in the short term in order to compe@@ te , and by that , they might have to focus more ag@@ gressi@@ vely on economic out@@ comes to help create the middle class and therefore be able to hold government accoun@@ table and create the democra@@ cies that we really want .
well he also saw that when health care turns to medical care because of a more serious disease , the key thing that hol@@ ds us back is access to information .
however , while it &apos;s easier to think of us , the citizens , the police , the army , as the good guys , and them , the nar@@ co@@ s , the car@@ tel@@ es , as the bad guys , if you think about it , the lat@@ ter are only provi@@ ding a service to the former .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , pri@@ mar@@ ily the form at least , to fit these con@@ tex@@ ts , and if we make art to fit g@@ aller@@ y walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit exi@@ sting operating systems , is that how it works ?
politics and politicians will only succe@@ ed if they actually try and treat with people as they are , rather than as they would like them to be .
but i &apos;m going to try and do something different , and try and just close the loo@@ p with some of my personal stories , and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we &apos;ve been talking about .
i &apos;m a little bit of an ama@@ te@@ ur histor@@ ian , so i &apos;ve spent some time going back , trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing . and the best , earli@@ est quote that i could find was one from david li@@ v@@ ing@@ stone , writing in the 18@@ 5@@ 0s about how the ra@@ il@@ road , the ste@@ am ship , and the tele@@ graph were integr@@ ating east africa perfectly with the rest of the world .
we decided to do something a little bit different and transform fla@@ vor@@ s that were very familiar -- so in this case , so we take a car@@ rot ca@@ ke , put it in a bl@@ ender , and we have kind of like a car@@ rot ca@@ ke ju@@ ice , and then that went into a ballo@@ on fro@@ zen in liquid ni@@ tro@@ gen to create this hol@@ low sh@@ ell of car@@ rot ca@@ ke ice cre@@ am , i guess , and it comes off looking like , you know , ju@@ pit@@ er &apos;s flo@@ ating around your pla@@ te .
and the scale of my work , and the kinds of ideas i &apos;m playing with -- when i first saw an ima@@ x film , i almost immediately thought , &quot; there &apos;s a real res@@ on@@ ance between what i &apos;m trying to do and the scale of what i try to do as a photograph@@ er . &quot;
but that ... process is what i think of as science , see , where you start with some idea , and then instead of , like , looking up , every auth@@ ority that you &apos;ve ever heard of i -- sometimes you do that , if you &apos;re going to write a paper later , you want to figure out who else has worked on it .
and he said , &quot; no , no , really . you can .
what &apos;s actually happening is that what were previ@@ ously lo@@ c@@ alized par@@ o@@ chi@@ al@@ is@@ ms , individual or grou@@ p@@ ings of extre@@ mi@@ sts who were isol@@ ated from one another , have become inter@@ connected in a glob@@ alized way and have th@@ us become , or are becoming , main@@ stream .
and of course consider images that can be sensor@@ y patterns , visual , such as you &apos;re having right now in relation to the stage and me , or audi@@ tory images , as you are having now in relation to my words .
so you can buy app@@ s and make pur@@ ch@@ ases within those app@@ s , but you think about ama@@ zon , you look at the trust bar@@ ome@@ ter that i showed you where people are starting to trust businesses , especially businesses that they believe in and trust more than governments .
and it will be sub-@@ or@@ b@@ ital . and the reason it has to be sub-@@ or@@ b@@ ital is , there is not solutions for ade@@ qu@@ ate safety to fly the public to orbit . the governments have been doing this -- three governments have been doing this for 45 years , and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died .
and it is cru@@ cial -- it is cru@@ cial in a practical , activ@@ ist way -- for people who care about these issues to make sure that within the technology of democracy , in this system , they exercise their pre@@ fer@@ ences , their choices and their voices to encoura@@ ge that out@@ come .
and i decided the reme@@ dy to all this mal@@ a@@ ise was going to be for me to ch@@ ase an el@@ ev@@ ated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require u@@ tter con@@ vi@@ ction and un@@ wa@@ vering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspe@@ ct of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that i couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of con@@ vi@@ ction .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative lea@@ p you can make .
and for the following 25 years , living in it@@ al@@ y , living in america , i dol@@ ed out a piece of this roman@@ ce to anybody who &apos;d pay for it -- this sense , this a@@ es@@ thetic feeling , for the experience revol@@ ving around a designed object .
commer@@ ce , on the other hand , is relatively quick , essentially creative , highly effective and efficient , and fundament@@ ally honest , because we can &apos;t exchange value for very long if we don &apos;t trust each other .
do with both hands , and quick . yes , good , good .
and i think if you think about life without play -- no humor , no fli@@ r@@ tation , no movies , no games , no fan@@ t@@ asy and , and , and .
it was made in stars like that , lo@@ cked away and then re@@ turned to the universe in explo@@ sions like that in order to re@@ con@@ den@@ se into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
so they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whi@@ che@@ ver of them is ele@@ cted -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when i came back from k@@ yo@@ to in 199@@ 7 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that break@@ through there , and then con@@ fron@@ ted the united states sen@@ ate , only one out of 100 sen@@ ators was willing to vote to con@@ fir@@ m , to ra@@ ti@@ fy that treat@@ y . whatever the can@@ di@@ dat@@ es say has to be la@@ id al@@ on@@ g@@ side what the people say .
so it &apos;s very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that i talk about in my book , &quot; world 3@@ .@@ 0 , &quot; that we &apos;re very , very far from the no@@ -@@ bor@@ der effect ben@@ ch@@ mark , which would imp@@ ly internation@@ alization levels of the order of 85 , 90 , 95 percent .
but what &apos;s key here is , the reason these groups have been able to connect is because their work out@@ put is of the type that can be easily shared digit@@ ally -- a picture , a music fi@@ le , software .
but much more , to get ad@@ vices , to give your comm@@ ents , to spread the word that if it &apos;s possible in the air , of course it &apos;s possible in the ground .
or -- or maybe and -- in addition to rules , let &apos;s see if we can come up with some really clever in@@ centi@@ ves so that , even if the people we deal with don &apos;t particularly want to serve our interests , it is in their interest to serve our interest -- the magic in@@ centi@@ ves that will get people to do the right thing even out of p@@ ure sel@@ fis@@ hn@@ ess .
now , the particular species of dra@@ gon@@ fly i want to talk about is this one , because most dra@@ gon@@ flies , like the one we &apos;ve just seen , when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life , it doesn &apos;t go very far . it can &apos;t travel very far .
the days are past when a person , company or brand could ti@@ ghtly control their repu@@ tation -- online ch@@ at@@ ter and sp@@ in mean that if you &apos;re relevant , there &apos;s a const@@ ant , fre@@ e-@@ form conversation happening about you that you have no control over . tim le@@ ber@@ echt off@@ ers three big ideas about accep@@ ting that loss of control , even designing for it -- and using it as an im@@ pe@@ tus to re@@ com@@ mit to your values .
the problem was , after a few years of doing that , i realized i had done -- i had been to maybe six or seven programs , and i thought , you know , if i keep this up at this p@@ ace , over my whole career , maybe i &apos;m going to go to maybe 20 or 30 programs .
but in at least a large class of cases , one can think of the universe as being like some kind of network , which , when it gets big enough , beha@@ ves like continu@@ ous space in much the same way as having lots of molecules can be@@ have like a continu@@ ous flu@@ id .
another thing that information technology lets us do is start fig@@ uring out how to use less stuff by knowing , and by monit@@ or@@ ing , the amount we &apos;re actually using .
and the good thing about percei@@ ving ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is that you can hear if it &apos;s a good day or a bad day to sun@@ ba@@ the , because ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let is a dangerous color , a color that can actually kill us , so i think we should all have this wish to percei@@ ve things that we cannot percei@@ ve .
door , door , door , you know , color , you know what i &apos;m saying .
and it &apos;s very , very common for designers and people in the visual arts to feel that we &apos;re not contribu@@ ting enough , or worse , that all we &apos;re doing is contribu@@ ting to land@@ fill .
i was walking around on the streets of am@@ ster@@ dam and i recogni@@ zed , you know , the big story from am@@ ster@@ dam isn &apos;t what &apos;s in the design stor@@ es , it &apos;s what &apos;s out on the streets , and maybe it &apos;s self-@@ explan@@ atory , but a city that hasn &apos;t been taken over by moder@@ nis@@ m , that &apos;s preser@@ ved its kind of architecture and character , and where the bi@@ cycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an rights are prote@@ cted .
what we need is another hero generation . those of us who are alive in the united states of america today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has pres@@ ented us with a choice -- just as j@@ ill &#91; bol@@ te &#93; ta@@ yl@@ or was fig@@ uring out how to save her life while she was di@@ stra@@ cted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
and i do think pattern has the cap@@ ability of er@@ a@@ dic@@ ating some of the most evil forces of society , such as bad form in restaurants , but quite seriously , it was a stat@@ ement to me that one thing that you do , sort of , see is the ag@@ gressi@@ ve nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of , large mas@@ ses of things , and when you -- in mon@@ o@@ culture , and i think the preser@@ vation of diversity in culture is something that &apos;s important to us .
so what i did is i took all of the intervie@@ ws where i saw wor@@ thin@@ ess , where i saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
and now string theory comes along and says , yes , gravity , quant@@ um mechan@@ ics , electro@@ magne@@ tis@@ m , all together in one pac@@ ka@@ ge , but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see .
one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of this whole system is we &apos;re discus@@ sing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assu@@ mption , and one of the best gu@@ esses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absor@@ b sun@@ light , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black ri@@ vers .
there are three tru@@ cks there . you &apos;re going to instin@@ c@@ tively go for the white tru@@ ck , because that &apos;s the top tru@@ ck from your perspective , but then you have to remember , &quot; oh , he can &apos;t see that tru@@ ck , so he must mean me to move the blue tru@@ ck , &quot; which is the top tru@@ ck from his perspective . now believe it or not , normal , healthy , intelligent adults like you make er@@ r@@ ors about 50 percent of the time on that kind of trial .
and as you &apos;ll see in this simulation , as they interact they gain points , as it were , they grow , and when they &apos;ve dou@@ bled in size , you &apos;ll see them spli@@ t , and that &apos;s how they re@@ produce and the population gro@@ ws .
i believe that there are new , hidden ten@@ sions that are actually happening between people and institutions -- institutions that are the institutions that people in@@ hab@@ it in their daily life : schools , hospitals , work@@ places , fac@@ tor@@ ies , off@@ ices , etc .
now -- oh , oh yeah , go on then , go on .
just look at google maps here . there &apos;s block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
fif@@ ty percent will have on@@ set by age 14 , 75 percent by age 24 , a picture that is very different than what one would see if you &apos;re talking about cancer or heart disease , diabetes , hyper@@ ten@@ sion -- most of the major ill@@ n@@ esses that we think about as being sources of mor@@ bi@@ di@@ ty and mortality .
so with that , i &apos;d like to say a few words about up@@ gra@@ ding , and share with you a gli@@ mp@@ se from my current project , which is different from the previous one , but it shares exactly the same characteri@@ stics of self-@@ learning , learning by doing , self-@@ exploration and commun@@ it@@ y-@@ building , and this project de@@ als with k-@@ 12 math education , beginning with early age math , and we do it on tab@@ lets because we believe that math , like anything else , should be taught hands on .
they &apos;re fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest in a world that &apos;s clean , a world that isn &apos;t cont@@ amin@@ ated , a world that isn &apos;t pollu@@ ted .
when people are asked about these two different jobs : a job where you make 6@@ 0@@ k , then 50@@ k , then 40@@ k , a job where you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary cut each year , and one in which you &apos;re getting a sal@@ ary increase , people like the second job better than the first , despite the fact they &apos;re all told they make much less money . why ?
in fact , she indi@@ cated that if we would do that , not only would we have the joy of recei@@ ving the gra@@ titude from the members of the exten@@ ded family , but she said , &quot; even god will s@@ mile , and when god s@@ miles , there is peace , and justice , and joy . &quot;
that as we explore these str@@ ings of a &apos;s , t &apos;s , c &apos;s and g &apos;s , we may un@@ cover a completely new class of life that , like bei@@ jer@@ in@@ ck , will fundament@@ ally change the way that we think about the nature of biology .
and i started in our medical university , kar@@ ol@@ in@@ sk@@ a institute , an under@@ graduate course called global health . but when you get that opportunity , you get a little nervous . i thought , these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in swe@@ dis@@ h college systems -- so , i thought , maybe they know everything i &apos;m going to teach them about . so i did a pre-@@ test when they came .
you de@@ code what you want to fold up into , into a sequence of an@@ gles -- so negative 120 , negative 120 , 0 , 0 , 120 , negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of an@@ gles , or turns , and you send that sequence through the string .
i &apos;ve had some that could and wouldn &apos;t , and i &apos;ve had some that would and couldn &apos;t .
in those days there was still coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side close to the city , far@@ ms , cor@@ n@@ fields , co@@ ws ; even not far from our building with its bl@@ ur@@ red bri@@ ck and long sha@@ dow@@ y hall@@ way you could find tra@@ cts with h@@ ills and trees you could pre@@ tend were mountains and fore@@ sts .
not only is there a relationship between the eth@@ ics of science and the eth@@ ics of being a citi@@ zen in democracy , but there has been , histor@@ ically , a relationship between how people think about space and time , and what the co@@ smo@@ s is , and how people think about the society that they live in .
they go out and point a telescop@@ e at the sky , take a picture , identify what are stars and throw them away , look at the galaxies , esti@@ mate how far away they are , and p@@ lot them up .
the girl , my old love , the last lost time i saw her when she came to find me at a party , her dr@@ un@@ ken@@ ly st@@ um@@ bling , fall@@ ing , spra@@ w@@ ling , sk@@ ir@@ t hi@@ ked , eyes v@@ ein@@ ed red , s@@ wollen with te@@ ars , her sh@@ ame , her dis@@ honor .
i &apos;ll play at these rock shows , be on stage standing completely still , and they &apos;re like , &quot; what &apos;s she doing ? ! what &apos;s she doing ? ! &quot;
my@@ th number two : or@@ p@@ he@@ us , wonderful guy , char@@ ming to be around , great parti@@ er , great sing@@ er , lo@@ ses his belo@@ ved , char@@ ms his way into the under@@ world , only person to char@@ m his way into the under@@ world , char@@ ms the go@@ ds of the under@@ world , they rele@@ ase his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
now , she cho@@ se c , g , b , a , e .
so the challenge was to try and get them to do what we wanted them to do by listening to the weather , the lay of the land , and creating things that would let the she@@ ep flow and go where we wanted them to go .
now , i was raised in the pacific nor@@ th@@ west , around a lot of church of lat@@ ter-@@ day sa@@ in@@ ts people and , you know , i &apos;ve worked with them and even d@@ ated them , but i never really knew the doc@@ tr@@ ine or what they said to people when they were out on a mission , and i guess i was , sort of , curious , so i said , &quot; well , please , come in . &quot; and they looked really happy , because i don &apos;t think this happens to them all that often .
so what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the u.@@ s , and the u.k. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infin@@ itely more money glob@@ ally than we could just in australia . and that money fu@@ els research , and that research will get us to a cure .
so what i &apos;m pro@@ pos@@ ing is , just as we require reading , writing , ari@@ th@@ me@@ tic , american history , so we should have a cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um on facts about all the religi@@ ons of the world -- about their history , about their cre@@ e@@ ds , about their tex@@ ts , their music , their symbo@@ li@@ sms , their pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions , their requi@@ re@@ ments .
so time , space , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , and then , most important , behavior .
i &apos;ve tried to show in this -- though the color doesn &apos;t come out -- that what i &apos;m concerned with is the little 5@@ 0-@@ year time bubble that you are in . you tend to be interested in a generation past , a generation future -- your parents , your kids , things you can change over the next few decades -- and this 5@@ 0-@@ year time bubble you kind of move along in . and in that 50 years , if you look at the population cur@@ ve , you find the population of humans on the earth more than dou@@ bles and we &apos;re up three-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half times since i was born . when you have a new baby , by the time that kid gets out of high school more people will be ad@@ ded than exi@@ sted on earth when i was born .
but what i have to do now , feeling again , what i &apos;ve got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzy@@ mes , of these tri@@ g@@ gers into something early on in the process , that you pick it up , not through your thinking , but through your feeling .
and it &apos;s my feeling and it &apos;s my ur@@ ging being here to know that , as we women move forward as the communic@@ ators of this , but also as the ones who carry that bur@@ den of carrying the children , be@@ aring the children , we hold most of the buying power in the hou@@ se@@ hold , is that it &apos;s going to be us moving forward to carry the work of ty@@ r@@ one and other scientists around the world .
so , i &apos;ve had an interesting laboratory to try to answer the question of the real question , which is what &apos;s the difference in somebody &apos;s life if you look at somebody like those people that you &apos;ve given everything to ? like all the resources they say they need . you gave them not a 10@@ 0-@@ dollar computer ; you gave them the best computer . you gave them love ; you gave them joy . you were there to comfort them .
there &apos;s this large , con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated far@@ ming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 19@@ 80 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con@@ soli@@ dation , mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of small farmers in this country .
if you walk like that , it &apos;s ok , it &apos;s ok , you can walk , but perhaps , because you walk with the eyes like that , you will not see , oh , there is a hole .
you see , the thing is o@@ bes@@ ity and di@@ et@@ -@@ related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , si@@ sters .
so we go , &quot; sit , &quot; on the cou@@ ch ; &quot; sit , &quot; tu@@ m@@ my@@ -@@ ru@@ b ; &quot; sit , &quot; look , i throw a ten@@ nis ball ; &quot; sit , &quot; say hell@@ o to that other dog .
because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place , country to country , and city to city , the degree to which women , for example , are viol@@ ated , and the epidemic of it , and the kind of ordin@@ ar@@ iness of it , is so de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing to one &apos;s sou@@ l that you have to take the time , or i have to take the time now , to process that .
the culture in which we live now is a@@ was@@ h with music of impro@@ vis@@ ation that &apos;s been sli@@ ced , di@@ ced , la@@ y@@ ered and , god knows , distribu@@ ted and sold .
i used to say that these people saved me , but what i now know is they did something even more important in that they em@@ powered me to save myself , and cru@@ cially , they helped me to understand something which i &apos;d always sus@@ pe@@ cted : that my voices were a meaning@@ ful response to trau@@ matic life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were not my ene@@ mi@@ es but a source of insi@@ ght into sol@@ vable emotional problems .
th : one of this things that &apos;s exciting and appropriate for me to be here at ted@@ women is that , well , i think it was su@@ mm@@ ed up best last night at dinner when someone said , &quot; turn to the man at your table and tell them , &apos; when the revolution starts , we &apos;ve got your back . &apos; &quot; the truth is , women , you &apos;ve had our back on this issue for a very long time , starting with ra@@ ch@@ el car@@ son &apos;s &quot; sil@@ ent spring &quot; to the@@ o col@@ born &apos;s &quot; our stol@@ en future &quot; to sand@@ ra stein@@ gr@@ aber &apos;s books &quot; living down@@ stream &quot; and &quot; having faith . &quot;
the adop@@ tion process took , like , a matter of months , so it was a closed shop , you know , se@@ aled deal , an industri@@ ous , u@@ tili@@ t@@ arian solution : the government , the farmer , the adop@@ ting parents , the consumer , the mother , the earth , and the child , the cro@@ p .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illu@@ str@@ ator -- since i was taught anima@@ tion by my father , who was a sculp@@ tor and my visual ment@@ or -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sci@@ ences by using anima@@ tion , by using pictures , by telling stories so that the things that are not necessarily evi@@ dent to people can be brought forth , and can be taught , and can be understood .
as a matter of fact , we think reach@@ ing 100 percent is very do@@ able , even before the 20@@ 15 ti@@ me@@ frame . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been soli@@ d , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , la@@ tin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently vis@@ iting south africa .
and it &apos;s interesting , if you think about it , how , when we think about the civili@@ zations that we look up to as having been p@@ inn@@ ac@@ les of human achie@@ vement -- whether it &apos;s china , gre@@ e@@ ce , the hin@@ du civilization , or the may@@ as , or eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans -- what we know about them is really about their ec@@ st@@ as@@ ies , not about their everyday life .
and during that time , they &apos;re doing everything from going out and doing eth@@ no@@ graphic research and doing the nee@@ d-@@ finding , coming back into the studio , doing the bra@@ in@@ stor@@ ming and design visu@@ alization to come up with concep@@ ts that might work , and then moving into the shop and actually testing them , building them , prototyp@@ ing them , fig@@ uring out if they are going to work and re@@ fin@@ ing that .
she then as@@ sig@@ ned these works ra@@ cial identi@@ ties , basically saying to me that the work on the right , clearly , was made by a black artist , the work on the left , clearly , by a white artist , when , in effect , that was the opposite case : bob col@@ es@@ c@@ ot@@ t , afri@@ can@@ -@@ american artist ; le@@ on gol@@ u@@ b , a white artist .
and the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quie@@ t , scre@@ aming des@@ per@@ ation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to en@@ able them to buy things they don &apos;t need to im@@ press people they don &apos;t like .
