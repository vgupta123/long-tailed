as the sky gets darker , and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees fahrenheit , the most environmentally hostile segment of helios &apos;s journey has gone by without notice , except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors . 
traditional lab tests for disease diagnosis can be too expensive and cumbersome for the regions most in need . george whitesides &apos; ingenious answer is a foolproof tool that can be manufactured at virtually zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
the first is if anything is unique about this research , it &apos;s less the science than the strategy -- that this for us was a social experiment , an experiment in what would happen if we were as open and honest at the earliest phase of discovery chemistry research as we could be . 
2011 was a year of extraordinary people-powered resistance , starting with arab spring and spreading across the world . how did this resistance work so well ? srdja popovic lays out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from nonviolent tactics to a sense of humor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
legendary skeptic james randi takes a fatal dose of homeopathic sleeping pills onstage , kicking off a searing 18-minute indictment of irrational beliefs . he throws out a challenge to the world &apos;s psychics : prove what you do is real , and i &apos;ll give you a million dollars . 
so what we &apos;re seeing is moving this burning or publication process from the regular sort of single-authored book towards community-authored materials that are modular , that are customized to each individual class and published on demand very inexpensively , either pushed out through amazon , or published directly through an on-demand press , like coop . 
throughout human evolution , multiple versions of humans co-existed . could we be mid-upgrade now ? at tedxsummit , juan enriquez sweeps across time and space to bring us to the present moment -- and shows how technology is revealing evidence that suggests rapid evolution may be under way . 
and as she was there on the edge of that stage , two stagehands all in black with watering cans ran along the top and started to pour water on the sand castle , and the sand castle started to drip and sink , but before it did , the audience saw the black-clad stagehands . 
it deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we &apos;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not potent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them . 
why do we argue ? to out-reason our opponents , prove them wrong , and , most of all , to win ! ... right ? philosopher daniel h. cohen shows how our most common form of argument -- a war in which one person must win and the other must lose -- misses out on the real benefits of engaging in active disagreement . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
speaking at the 2007 eg conference , trainer ian dunbar asks us to see the world through the eyes of our beloved dogs . by knowing our pets &apos; perspective , we can build their love and trust . it &apos;s a message that resonates well beyond the animal world . 
and then i went on to reflect , &quot; isn &apos;t it amazing , this entire database , all these recordings , i &apos;m going to hand off to you and to your sister &quot; -- who arrived two years later -- &quot; and you guys are going to be able to go back and re-experience moments that you could never , with your biological memory , possibly remember the way you can now ? &quot; 
during this chapter one , there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe , and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that , in fact , a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could , in some ways , mean the end of civilization as we know it . 
and to do that meant creating the flattest gradients that had ever yet been made , which meant building long viaducts across river valleys -- this is actually the viaduct across the thames at maidenhead -- and long tunnels such as the one at box , in wiltshire . 
again , we are making holes in the skull about the size of a dime , putting an electrode in , and then this electrode is completely underneath the skin down to a pacemaker in the chest , and with a remote control very much like a television remote control , we can adjust how much electricity we deliver to these areas of the brain . 
then when you exit the imax theatre on the fourth floor -- mostly teenagers coming out of there -- there &apos;s this big open space that has these tables in it that have interactive games which are quite fun , also designed by durrell &#91; bishop &#93; and andrew &#91; hirniak &#93; of itch . 
now , the moon has no atmosphere , so micrometeorites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bombarded by micrometeorites , and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vaporize on contact . 
but it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern experimental technologies , a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated -- you &apos;ll be relieved to know that i do something useful in my day job , rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story -- but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings and modern statistical techniques . 
what is this ? this is the first transplant of naked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , insert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff . 
it &apos;s proportionally much bigger in humans than in any other species , and it &apos;s involved in a whole range of high level cognitive functions , things like decision-making , planning , planning what you &apos;re going to do tomorrow or next week or next year , inhibiting inappropriate behavior , so stopping yourself saying something really rude or doing something really stupid . 
the world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . this is the paradoxical answer that hans rosling unveils at ted @ cannes using colorful new data display technology . 
so i &apos;ve colored in the glycines again in green , alanine in red , and the serines , the letter s , in purple . and you can see that the top repeat unit can be explained almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repeat unit has a substantial amount of purple . 
on december 29th , u.s. troops surrounded a sioux encampment at wounded knee creek and massacred chief big foot and 300 prisoners of war , using a new rapid-fire weapon that fired exploding shells called a hotchkiss gun . 
we see companies like the brazilian forestry company fibria that &apos;s figured out how to avoid tearing down old growth forest and using eucalyptus and getting much more yield per hectare of pulp and making much more paper than you could make by cutting down those old trees . 
so , we &apos;re talking about things like inflatable liners that can conform to the complex topological shape on the inside of a cave , foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology , various ways of getting breathing gases made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies . 
everything in this world exists in africa . and you can &apos;t discuss universal access to hiv &#91; medicine &#93; for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here . the improvement of the world must be highly contextualized , and it &apos;s not relevant to have it on regional level . we must be much more detailed . 
some of you guys will fix that one day , but anything that &apos;s not flat on a screen is a new dimension , goes smaller , smaller , smaller , and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself , this is the idea , you could have additional curled up dimensions -- here is a little shape of a circle -- so small that we don &apos;t see them . 
but these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with hans holbein &apos;s &quot; ambassadors . &quot; and hans holbein worked for henry viii . this was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull . 
because , if the board of directors convince everybody that the success of any organization is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors , it makes the disparity in salaries slightly more justifiable than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company &apos;s success might actually lie somewhere else , in small pieces of tactical activity . 
can opera be ever-so-slightly sexy ? the glorious soprano danielle de niese shows how , singing the flirty &quot; meine lippen , sie küssen so heiss . &quot; which , translated , means , as you might guess : &quot; i kiss so hot . &quot; from giuditta by frans lehár ; accompanist : ingrid surgenor .

av : yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps , the first smile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being , our house , any time from six to seven every night . 
you know , it seems at this stage in your life , you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- i suppose it &apos;s an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson &apos;s and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life . 
so , some societies , for subtle environmental reasons , are more fragile than others . and then finally , another generalization . i &apos;m now teaching a course at ucla , to ucla undergraduates , on these collapses of societies . what really bugs my ucla undergraduate students is , how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing ? 
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century , the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats , so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place . 
right now , it feels like i forgot to turn the light on and things that looked so good yesterday are now shades of gray and it seems like the world is spinning while i &apos;m standing still or maybe i am spinning i can &apos;t tell and then you say hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe and now the words sing hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe now everybody sings hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe hey you &apos;re okay you &apos;ll be fine just breathe thank you . 
today &apos;s professional theater community is defined , not only the shaw and stratford festivals , but by the cornerstone theater of los angeles -- a collective of artists that after 9 / 11 , brought together 10 different religious communities -- the bahia , the catholic , the muslim , the jewish , even the native american and the gay and lesbian communities of faith , helping them create their own individual plays and one massive play , where they explored the differences in their faith and found commonality as an important first step toward cross-community healing . 
we &apos;ve been working on this , actually , as an alternative energy source , starting way back with johnson &amp; amp ; johnson , to run an ibot , because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead , 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium , 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride , 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium , 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars . 
they have actually retained access to the profitable drug trade , but the way they do it is , because they control all of michoacán , and they control the port of lázaro cárdenas , they leverage that to , for example , trade copper from michoacán that is legally created and legally extracted with illegal ephedrine from china which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines that they produce , and then they have partnerships with larger organizations like the sinaloa federation that place their products in the u.s . 
due to some slip-ups , he managed to escape dressed as a woman and ran from london back to nigeria where , according to our constitution , those in office as governors , president -- as in many countries -- have immunity and cannot be prosecuted . but what happened : people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office .

and — — the nurse kind of had a hysterical laugh , and i &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flood victims of bangladesh , and then i look over and my anesthesiologist is clamping the mask on me , and i think , &quot; he looks bangladeshi , &quot; — — and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &quot; this could work somehow . &quot; 
i &apos;ll go you one stranger than that : in 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to &quot; the maltese falcon , &quot; called &quot; the black bird , &quot; starring george segal , the los angeles county museum of art had a plaster original of the maltese falcon -- one of the original six plasters , i think , made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum . a lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie . 
after he swam the north pole , lewis pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip . then he heard of lake imja in the himalayas , created by recent glacial melting , and lake pumori , a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change . 
early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . at tedxpeachtree , ami klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-tracking technologies to gauge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

how do you read a two-thousand-year-old manuscript that has been erased , cut up , written on and painted over ? with a powerful particle accelerator , of course ! ancient books curator william noel tells the fascinating story behind the archimedes palimpsest , a byzantine prayer book containing previously-unknown original writings from ancient greek mathematician archimedes and others . 
when senior fellow cesar harada heard about the devastating effects of the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico in 2010 , he quit his dream job and moved to new orleans to develop a more efficient way to soak up the oil . he designed a highly maneuverable , flexible boat capable of cleaning large tracts quickly . but rather than turn a profit , he has opted to open-source the design . 
now to begin to overcome our ignorance of the role of brain chemistry in brain circuitry , it &apos;s helpful to work on what we biologists call &quot; model organisms , &quot; animals like fruit flies and laboratory mice , in which we can apply powerful genetic techniques to <<unk>> arly identify and pinpoint specific classes of neurons , as you heard about in allan jones &apos;s talk this morning . 
macarthur winner sendhil mullainathan uses the lens of behavioral economics to study a tricky set of social problems -- those we know how to solve , but don &apos;t . we know how to reduce child deaths due to diarrhea , how to prevent diabetes-related blindness and how to implement solar-cell technology ... yet somehow , we don &apos;t or can &apos;t . why ?

and over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water creating enormous pressure , forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth , until it hits a magma chamber where it becomes superheated and supersaturated with minerals , reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at yellowstone . 
collecting global health data was an imperfect science : workers tramped through villages to knock on doors and ask questions , wrote the answers on paper forms , then input the data -- and from this gappy information , countries would make huge decisions . data geek joel selanikio talks through the sea change in collecting health data in the past decade -- starting with the palm pilot and hotmail , and now moving into the cloud . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; 
everybody was really excited about curiosity , and that had this big plutonium battery on board that has plutonium-238 , which actually has a higher specific activity than the low-enriched uranium fuel of these molten salt reactors , which means that the effects would be negligible , because you launch it cold , and when it gets into space is where you actually activate this reactor . 
environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . but there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the midwest to the northeast , and from western europe to the arctic , and from the midwest out the mississippi into the dead zone of the gulf of mexico . 
then you notice that if that lego-provided cad program isn &apos;t enough , there &apos;s an entire open-source , third-party , independent lego cad program that lets you do 3d modeling and 3d rendering and make , in fact , movies out of lego , 3d films of which there are thousands on youtube , and some of them sort of mimicking famous films and some totally original content -- just beautiful -- and people recreating all sorts of things .
